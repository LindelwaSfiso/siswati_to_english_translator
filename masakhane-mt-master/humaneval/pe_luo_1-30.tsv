But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.	Buht ma en bwendni, tat, tongongongezi.		0	0	6
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.	Tdibu, tat, tat, sahadibbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbu,.		0	0	4
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.	Abam ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	6
We forgot responsibility.	Wost ma ne en sabbbbbbbby.		0	0	5
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.	Tsadsi ma ne en mita bia.		0	0	6
We forgot about improving normal lives.	Woja Wot ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	7
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive.	Womt, mmsut, ma ne en mmsut, tabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbal,.		0	0	7
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.	Abul, dddddddddbo, glu, kata ddddddddddddddddbo.		0	0	5
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.	Adibo, glu, tahat, Nahnt, Dahbbsabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbsabbu, ma ne aluwo.		0	0	8
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.	Tdihnt ma nigi sbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbh.		0	0	4
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.	Isbh ma en msut.		0	0	4

And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.	Abul msut, tala, tala, sapala, sapala, sapahabbbbbbbbith, kata glu.		0	0	9
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.	Sihnt, ma ne en ssachsachsabp, ma ne en ssachsabp, ma ne en ssasabbbbsabbbbbbsasabbp.		0	0	13

But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?	Madibul, dddddddddddy, ma en dddddddddddddddddddlda, ma en-ddddddddddddddn?		0	0	7
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.	Alag-tat-bbam ma ne en bbam ma ne en bwendni.		0	0	9
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.	Abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb                                                                           		0	0	75
The first happy life is the pleasant life.	Thin-ssssssssa, ma en tuwo ma ji ne tiyogo.		0	0	8

The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.	Tdir, gwen ma nigi tuwo mar sut-lllllllllllllllllllllllllal, glu, glas, suhllllllllal, ma.		0	0	11
That's what Aristotle was talking about.	Tut ma nigi tuwo miluongo ni Abol Abam, ma en tuwo mapep.		0	0	12
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.	Swenda ne en msut.		0	0	4
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.	Abul, tat, tat-tat, tala-sapat, tat-tat, tat, ssadko-sa, ma en-ssaihnn, ma ne miyo del bedo jing’.		0	0	15
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.	Buht ma ne itiyogo e loso tat, tat-tat ma ne itiyogo e sabbbbam, ma ne en ssabp, ma ne en ssabp, ma ne miyo ji bedo jing’.		0	0	27
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.	Tat, ddddddddddddddddddddddddddda, ma ne en ssadddddddddddddda, ma ne en ssaddddddddddddddddddddddddsale.		0	0	10
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.	Snzal, ma en tuwo mar ddddddddddddddddddddal, ma en-ddddddddddddddal.		0	0	8
Second is that positive emotion habituates.	Secnd gi tat, ma en sapat, ma en ttat.		0	0	9
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.	Rech ma ne nie twath moro miluongo ni Fsachsaba, ma ne en tuwo mar mtaro, fut 1dsabp.		0	0	17

I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question, are there things that lastingly change those lives?	Ne adibam, dddddddddddddddlda, ma en dddddddddddddddddddddlda, ma?		0	0	7

And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.

And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get?	Abam ma en dddddddwu?		0	0	4
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?	Madibu, dddddddddddddddddda, ma en sbbbbbbbbbbbbam, ma en-bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb@@		0	0	7
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.	Abam ma en bwangbbbbbam, ma en bwangbbbom.		0	0	7
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.	Itnt ma nigi tuwo mar tat, ma en tat.		0	0	9
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.	Thin-sa, ma en sif ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	9
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.	Thin-sa, ma en msut.		0	0	4
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.	Wehabbbbbbbbu, ma en tuwo mar sut.		0	0	6
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.	Wadh Wat, tam, ma en sum mar lin-tate-tate.		0	0	8

That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?	Tat, gwen, gwen ma nigi tuwo miluongo ni Totddddddddddddddddddnle, ma en le ma iye?		0	0	14
Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life?	Rehbh ma nigi tuwo mar dddddasta, ma en tuwo ma chalo nade?		0	0	12

We all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes.	Wadil-ddddddddddddbbbbbbbbbbbbi.		0	0	1
We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery.	Wadibo, gwen msut, msut, kata glas.		0	0	6
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important.	Abul, tabbbbbbbbbbbbus.		0	0	2
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.

And I never found that.	Asabwa ne chalo mana gi pien dend dhano.		0	0	8

And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.	Alabo, tala, sahahat, ma en bwwangbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbwa, ma en bwogowa.		0	0	9
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion, and that's typically how they've been used.

And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.	Absadt, ma en bwwendni, ma en bwendni mag ji 180.		0	0	10

And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years, can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.	Absadssadssabp, ma ne en ssadsbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbsasasabbp, ma en-sasabbbbbbbbbbbbsasasasasasap, ma.		0	0	8

But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.	Buht ma en bwendni, tat, tongongongezi.		0	0	6
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.	Tdibu, tat, tat, sahadibbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbu,.		0	0	4
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.	Abam ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	6
We forgot responsibility.	Wost ma ne en sabbbbbbbby.		0	0	5
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.	Tsadsi ma ne en mita bia.		0	0	6
We forgot about improving normal lives.	Woja Wot ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	7
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive.	Womt, mmsut, ma ne en mmsut, tabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbal,.		0	0	7
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.	Abul, dddddddddbo, glu, kata ddddddddddddddddbo.		0	0	5
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.	Adibo, glu, tahat, Nahnt, Dahbbsabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbsabbu, ma ne aluwo.		0	0	8
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.	Tdihnt ma nigi sbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbh.		0	0	4
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.	Isbh ma en msut.		0	0	4
It should be interested in the best things in life.	Isbam ma en msut.		0	0	4
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.	Abul msut, tala, tala, sapala, sapala, sapahabbbbbbbbith, kata glu.		0	0	9
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.	Sihnt, ma ne en ssachsachsabp, ma ne en ssachsabp, ma ne en ssasabbbbsabbbbbbsasabbp.		0	0	13

We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.	Ndddddddy, ma ne en sbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbsabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb@@		0	0	5

But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?	Madibul, dddddddddddy, ma en dddddddddddddddddddlda, ma en-ddddddddddddddn?		0	0	7
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.	Alag-tat-bbam ma ne en bbam ma ne en bwendni.		0	0	9
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.

The first happy life is the pleasant life.	Thin-ssssssssa, ma en tuwo ma ji ne tiyogo.		0	0	8
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it.	Tin-Tis ma nigi tuwo miluongo ni Tihnibu, ma en le ma nigi tuwo mar sut.		0	0	15
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.	Tdir, gwen ma nigi tuwo mar sut-lllllllllllllllllllllllllal, glu, glas, suhllllllllal, ma.		0	0	11
That's what Aristotle was talking about.	Tut ma nigi tuwo miluongo ni Abol Abam, ma en tuwo mapep.		0	0	12
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.	Swenda ne en msut.		0	0	4
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.	Abul, tat, tat-tat, tala-sapat, tat-tat, tat, ssadko-sa, ma en-ssaihnn, ma ne miyo del bedo jing’.		0	0	15
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.	Buht ma ne itiyogo e loso tat, tat-tat ma ne itiyogo e sabbbbam, ma ne en ssabp, ma ne en ssabp, ma ne miyo ji bedo jing’.		0	0	27
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.	Tat, ddddddddddddddddddddddddddda, ma ne en ssadddddddddddddda, ma ne en ssaddddddddddddddddddddddddsale.		0	0	10
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.	Snzal, ma en tuwo mar ddddddddddddddddddddal, ma en-ddddddddddddddal.		0	0	8
Second is that positive emotion habituates.	Secnd gi tat, ma en sapat, ma en ttat.		0	0	9
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.	Rech ma ne nie twath moro miluongo ni Fsachsaba, ma ne en tuwo mar mtaro, fut 1dsabp.		0	0	17

For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.	Fodir-ttan, ma ne en Sucnssssabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbby.		0	0	5
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.	Madit-dddnn, ma en bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb                                                                 		0	0	68
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.

Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.	Suhnt-Baba, ma en sum mar msut.		0	0	6
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.	Wahnn, Codir, ma en Cosddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddhap, ma ne en mita 1000-20,60,6000000099.		0	0	10

For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.

Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen, and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed.

But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.	But ma nigi sbbbbbbo, ma en bwangcbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb                                  		0	0	40

and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families.	Madiby Wabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbby, ma en bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbsabbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb@@		0	0	5

And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads.	Abbat, Madiba, Sbbbbban, Sbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbby, Rat, Rahat, ma ma, Swita, Rahnn, Swnn, Swita, Nssssaihnn.		0	0	13
Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago?	Ddddddddddddddddddte, ma ne en jahigni 20, ma ne en jahigni 2560.		0	0	11
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages?	Abbbbbbbo, ma en bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb                                     		0	0	40

How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?	Hoby ma nigi tuwo mar dddddddddddd                                                                               		0	0	84
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.	Ne achopa e sabam ma ne en bwogowa.		0	0	8
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.	Soo, ne awito yugi e tahat.		0	0	6
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind.
