After you.	After you don.	Afta you. 	0.00	26.71	1.00
Hey, are you from Canada?	Halk, Canada.	How far, na Canada you come from?	0.00	17.84	1.00
So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.	So I no fit talk sey I no go fit buy anything wey person fit do.	So no, na so I no come dey fear to get mind. 	0.00	18.64	1.00

So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.	So now, I dey waka pass before. I dey waka pass before. I come dey waka with one thousand years wey I need, and I no need          	So now, I dey waka pass for di hall, and my hip dey pain me, so I need sign say everytin go make sense.	22.91	34.79	1.17
In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, "Volunteers Needed."	For where dem dey call Vinter wey dey call Veeting, dem no get anything wey dem fit do for Neeting Vinity.	For the windo for di hospital gift shop wey small, one sign dey dia wey tok say, "pipu wey go dash us from dia time do work wey no dey pay money".	0.00	16.84	0.84
Well, they signed me up immediately.	The way dem take dey make me strong.	Na so dem regista me quick quick	0.00	13.33	1.00
No reference checks.	No.	No confam from pipu wey sab	0.00	8.75	1.00
They were desperate for volunteers because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.	Dem use all their mind support the work wey dem dey do for Jehovah work. Na 75 years dem take fight war.	Dem need pipu wey go dash us from dia time do work wey no dey pay money because the pipu wey dey dia don old gan, na 75 years old be di midu age.	0.00	0.00	22.00
Yeah.	Im name na Abeg.	Yeah.	0.00	0.00	4.00
So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.	Na im make I come know sey I don ready to use all my power do the work wey I want do for Jehovah work.	Na so I come get my uniform wey be light blue, I come get ID, my oga wey be 89 years old come teach me di work.	0.00	0.00	25.00
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.	Me and my wife for our house when I reach house.	Every Friday momo, I don dey di gift shop.	0.00	0.00	11.00
While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs, I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"	When dem dey hospital, dem dey arrange things well well. E good make you ask yourself sey, ‘ Wetin you dey do?	As I dey collect hospital pipu sweet, I go ask dem wit style say, "wetin you dey do?"	0.00	0.00	22.00
Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.	E come dey hungry dem to tell dem sey make I go.	I go come yarn dem say, "Well, I dey replace my hip in 18 months.	0.00	0.00	12.00
It's gonna be so great when the pain stops.	The pain reach bone.	E go make sense wen di pain no dey again. 	0.00	0.00	4.00
All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.	Dem come carry the motor go where dem dey call Kumifer. The young                        	All di staff come sabi di pesin wey dey dash from dia time do work wey no dey pay money, wey. 	0.00	0.00	36.00
My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally, right after a shift at the gift shop.	The next thing pain me well well sotey I come see one ship wey dem dey call wood.	My next meeting wit docto na afta I don do gift shop work.	0.00	0.00	18.00
So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.	So, I come dey use all my mind and power take preach.	Na so I come dey wear my uniform and ID.	0.00	0.00	12.00
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.	I come tell dem sey I no go fit do the work wey dem dey do                          	I come hang dem for chair for inside docto office.	0.00	0.00	41.00
And you know, when he walked in, I could just tell that he saw them.	And as e dey waka, e come see sey e just see dem.	And as e dey waka, I come see say e just see dem.	0.00	0.00	13.00
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away, and a big fat prescription for Percocet.	After some weeks, I come get one room wey dem dey call Percle. Na so e still be for some weeks.	E no too tey, na so I get date for operation wey be in some weeks, and dem sama me plenti Percocet medicine.	0.00	0.00	21.00
Now, word on the street was that it was actually my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.	But now, the word wey I talk sey make I continue to support Jehovah work.	Now, pipu come dey tok say na my work wey I dey dash my time do work wey no dey pay money, na im make my operation date come front.	0.00	0.00	15.00
And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.	And you know sey e no easy for you.	And, you sabi say I no dey sha.	0.00	0.00	9.00
First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.	The first thing be sey, I go need to take care of this kind people.	The first thing be sey, I go need to take care of dis hip. 	0.00	0.00	15.00
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering, which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.	But I still dey use all my mind support the people wey dey direct the work.	But I still wan dey dash from my time do work wey no dey pay money.	0.00	0.00	16.00
Even when a Canadian cheats the system, they do it in a way that benefits society.	Even when Canaan people dey talk bad things about people wey dey do bad things, dem dey gain am well well.                 	Even when Canadian pipu dey play wayo, e dey cause beta for plenti pipu.	0.00	0.00	37.00

You can mimic what you can see.	You fit still see wetin you fit do.	You fit copy wetin you dey see. 	0.00	0.00	8.00
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.	You fit still get many things wey go make your mind come down.	You fit control all di muscle wey dey your arm.	0.00	0.00	13.00
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program, control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.	E get one time wey your rain dey blow, and e dey hard you to control yourself for there.	E no go tey wey you go fit dey see inside your brain dey control all di hundred areas you dey see wey dey your brain.	0.00	0.00	19.00
I'm going to tell you about that technology.	E dey hungry you to tell people about chnoon.	E dey hungry me to yarn you about dat technology.	0.00	0.00	9.00
People have wanted to look inside the human mind, the human brain, for thousands of years.	For many years, people want see sey dem no get money.	For thousands of years, people wan see how human mind and brain be. 	0.00	0.00	11.00
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.	E dey hard us to do research about the bad things wey we dey do before.	Now, research don move sotey we for our generation fit do am. 	0.00	0.00	16.00
People envision this as being very difficult.	For this vision, some people dey cause pain.	Pipu dey look am 	0.00	0.00	8.00
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.	As you dey waka near the place, you go see am well well.                           	You suppose take aeroplane wey dey comot dis earth, come make am small, come put am for inside blood. 	0.00	0.00	39.00
But now, we have a real technology to do this.	But now, we don see sey e dey hard us to do this one.	But now, we don see get wetin fit do am. 	0.00	0.00	14.00
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.	E just be like sey I dey travel go where dem dey call Peter Peter                           	We go travel enta inside di brain of my work mate Peter. 	0.00	0.00	41.00
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.	E dey hungry me to know more.	We no go need disturb to do am, we go use MRI. 	0.00	0.00	7.00
We don't have to inject anything.	We dey do everything wey we fit do.	We no need put anytin inside. 	0.00	0.00	8.00
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body -- but more importantly, we can look into his mind.	For example, we go come see sey e get one time wey Peter take carry im body down. But we go still see sey e no go hard us to see am as e be.	We go fit fly enta inside Peter brain - i mean am, inside im body - but di real mata na say, we go fit look inside im mind.	0.00	0.00	35.00
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.	When Peter dey look things wey dey happen, e dey help you see how e take dey help you.	Wen Peter dey move im arm, dat yello place na di tin wey dey link the working of Peter mind.	0.00	0.00	19.00
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms, that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.	But now, you don see sey person fit control you.	Now, you don see before dat with electrodes, you fit control robot arm, dat brain camera fit show you inside di brains. 	0.00	0.00	10.00
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.	E fit be sey the money wey dem dey spend pass anything wey dem dey do.	Wetin you no sabi be say di whole tin don take days or months of analysis. 	0.00	0.00	16.00
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds, and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.	E just be like sey the lawindows dey push us to see as e dey grow. E just be like sey e just be like where e dey stay.	We don use technology finish am quick quick, and e don allow us make Peter see inside im brain as e dey happen, as im dey inside di scanner. 	0.00	0.00	29.00
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.	E go talk about 6,000 people wey dey work for am.	E fit look dis 65,000 points wey dey activate every second. 	0.00	0.00	11.00
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.	If e see this one, e go help us know how to control ourself.	If e see dis pattern for him own brain, im fit sabi how im go control am.	0.00	0.00	14.00
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.	This one na the fourth thing wey you go do.	Dis one na fourth choice wey you go soon get. 	0.00	0.00	10.00
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.	Na all of us know sey we dey put mind for wetin we dey talk, and dey                               	We sabi say as we dey tink, dem dey form road wey deep for inside our brain. 	0.00	0.00	47.00
Chronic pain is an example.	Chronry story dey pain person.	Pain wey sharp na example. 	0.00	0.00	5.00
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time, it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.	But if dem dey prison for six month, dem still get strong faith for six month and dem still dey help you.	But if you still dey pain for six months or six years time, na because dis circuits dey produce pain wey no dey help you again. 	0.00	0.00	22.00
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain, we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information, and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.	If we want know more, we go see wetin we go do to show sey we dey put eye for where we suppose do reach. And we go still see the kind pain wey we go watch or wey we go watch.	If we fit look di activation for di brain wey dey cause di pain, we fit form 3D models and watch as di brain dey reason as e dey happen, den we fit select di areas wey dey cause di pain.	0.00	0.00	42.00

Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing.	You think sey you go quick run go meet your brain, and you go see sey e no go hard you to choose the same thing.	Now reason say you go soon fit dey look inside your brain and choose areas for di brain wey fit do di same tin. 	0.00	0.00	26.00
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.	If we dey patient, e go hard us to know how to control ourself.	Wetin you dey see so na say we don select di road for di brain of pesin wey dey get sharp pain. 	0.00	0.00	14.00
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.	This one fit make you no get time to read this kind Bible. But as time dey go, e fit be sey you                        	Dis one fit shock you.	0.00	0.00	46.00

As they do it, in the upper left is a display that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.	As dem dey grow, dem dey use their mind find better cloth wey go make dem no get belle.	As dem dey do am, for di upper left, you go see picture wey join to dia brain activation of dia own pain wey dem dey control. 	0.00	0.00	19.00
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.	When dem dey control dem, dem fit pain dem well well.	When dem dey control dia brain, dem dey control dia pain. 	0.00	0.00	11.00
This is an investigational technology, but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.	E get one time wey dem dey call pretend, but dem dey suffer well well well. Na around 64 people dey suffer dem well well.	Dis one na technology wey we still dey develop, but for hospital treatment, we don say pipu wey sick with sharp pain don reduce by 44 to 64 percent. 	0.00	0.00	25.00

That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.	This one go make dem kill plenty people.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein, which suggests that the approach might be a general one, and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases, not just Alzheimer’s disease.	Because of this one, the other things wey dem dey do for the war no mean sey dem no go let anything scatter the war. Dem fit still show sey dem no get gun wey dem dey call Alzatha, or the war.		0.00	0.00	42.00
There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here, because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers.	This one come make dem kill plenty people because dem no want put hand for war.		0.00	0.00	16.00

You should also keep your blood pressure down, because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.	Make you no forget sey your blood dey your head, because you want make the blood of another person.		0.00	0.00	19.00

Because the clock is ticking for all of us.	Because of this one, all of us dey come dey do things together.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.	Nari dey look everything wey dem dey call Vicda Leda.		0.00	0.00	10.00
We're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.	For example, e get one time wey e learn how to use im money take dey direct im work.		0.00	0.00	19.00
But we do not know his face.	But we no know sey e no know                                          		0.00	0.00	49.00
Thousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.	E don tey wey Jehovah Witness people write am about am, but e dey hungry am to talk about am.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.	Even with that one, many people dey talk bad about God.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?	E get one time wey dem dey call Varda Vardai Visi, wey dey Varry?		0.00	0.00	14.00
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.	Aaron na man wey im name na Leonon.		0.00	0.00	8.00
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.	The people wey dey carry body down, come carry me go where dem dey call animal, wey dey flinter, wey dem dey call binter,                 		0.00	0.00	40.00
I find that hard to believe.	I see sey I need to believe wetin I believe.		0.00	0.00	10.00
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters.	For example, e show sey e dey pity for people.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time.	But as time dey go, e good make we do like that. Na so e still be today.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So let's try to find them.	So make we try to see dem.		0.00	0.00	7.00
I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.	I dey think sey if we dey think about all this things, e go help us see sey we better pass other people.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.	So I come dey look all the people wey dey work for im house, and dem dey laugh me pass 700 km.		0.00	0.00	22.00
There are about 120, you see them here.	E get 120 years wey you see for there.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?	Wetin be some of this one?		0.00	0.00	6.00
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.	Dem dey praise dem for their work.		0.00	0.00	7.00
So we can eliminate all the profiles.	So make we do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we dey do the work.		0.00	0.00	18.00
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.	E still dey hard us to control ourself.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.	So, we fit still dey think sey we better pass other people.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.	For example, we know sey e dey pity for people.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.	So, we fit still get the kind mind wey people get.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Yes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.	Na so e still be for us today. Because of that one, the old man wey im name na Vitodus dey Vinter.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."	The only thing be sey, na only one of dem dey call Leasician Monasician Monan Monasian Monan Monan            		0.00	0.00	29.00
Before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.	Before we go, I tell dem why I suppose talk about them.		0.00	0.00	12.00
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.	E pass 300 years wey dem take dey pass 1,300 years.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.	So I know sey I never sabi pass before.		0.00	0.00	9.00
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.	KK am sey this kind thing dey happen for this three side.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.	If we hold Jehovah tight, e go make us remember how we take see some of the kind cloth wey the head of the head of the head of the river wey we get, and the kind hair wey we get.		0.00	0.00	41.00
I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.	When I see my husband well well, I come see sey no be small.		0.00	0.00	14.00
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.	E no get any reason why e be like that.		0.00	0.00	10.00
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar.	Na so e still be for some of the bad character wey people get today.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Now, are they made in the right order?	Now, dem make sure sey dem go do the right way?		0.00	0.00	11.00
The young man should be made first.	Na wetin happen to the first young man.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And as you see here from the years that they were created, it is indeed the case.	Na so e still be for many years wey dem make.		0.00	0.00	11.00
They are made in the right order.	Na wetin dem do be that.		0.00	0.00	6.00
What was the age of Leonardo at the time?	Wetin be the age wey dem dey call Leona                                   		0.00	0.00	43.00
Yes, it does.	Yes, na true.		0.00	0.00	3.00
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time.	So, we don talk about three things wey fit make us no too get time to do                             		0.00	0.00	45.00
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?	But how we go take know person wey no be im friend, and                                 		0.00	0.00	45.00
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.	The only picture wey dem take dey call Leonast                                  		0.00	0.00	42.00
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David, for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.	David come talk sey e get one small boy wey dem dey call Troio, wey be Nario.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.	And if we dey talk about the problem wey Jesus talk about, we dey face the same problem with the same person.                       		0.00	0.00	44.00
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces.	The three things wey Jesus talk about, and e show sey e get three character wey dem dey call Lev.                        		0.00	0.00	43.00

The icon of icons finally has a face.	The icycle come dey come out.		0.00	0.00	6.00
But modernization actually brought communication and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.	But make we dey put mind for the preaching work.		0.00	0.00	10.00

And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.	When I start to dey work with people, I come start to dey do things with dem for one place wey dem dey call pretend.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.	Na around 50 years dem start to do this work.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.	E get one time wey we dey sleep with people wey no get money, dem fit give us the money wey we get. Dem fit give us the money wey we get, or the money wey we get.		0.00	0.00	38.00
At the same time, I was thinking, well, there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products, away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.	E get one time wey I dey think well well, I dey think well well about wetin person fit do.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market.	So, for the whole world, I come see sey e no easy for me to take care of our book dem.		0.00	0.00	21.00
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes, forms.	E just be like sey we don start to dey see things like, to see something wey dey inside.		0.00	0.00	19.00
This is our group, our main group of weavers.	Na im make all of us be one group.		0.00	0.00	9.00
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.	Dem still need to do this one.		0.00	0.00	7.00
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.	Dem come go back from where dem dey call village.		0.00	0.00	10.00
It's a weekly turnaround of production.	E dey produce plenty things for life.		0.00	0.00	7.00
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.	This one show sey you get one mind.                                      		0.00	0.00	45.00
And that's also modernized today, and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.	Today, we dey try to show sey we dey support Jehovah work.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And the rest says it all.	E just be like sey all of us                                       		0.00	0.00	46.00
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.	So when I dey small, I come dey put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And I want to tell you that story.	And I want tell you sey I go tell you the story.		0.00	0.00	12.00
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.	I first tell am make I meet Brother Gardaker for Gentral Garoz.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.	E get one time wey e get one sickness wey dem dey call Penetia PIda PIACE. Na this one make the first time wey e go.		0.00	0.00	26.00
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.	E don tey wey dem call Gentral me Gensland, or 100 of dem                            		0.00	0.00	40.00
And I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space.	Dem carry me go where dem dey call Sisera. E come tell dem sey                              		0.00	0.00	43.00
And I said, "I can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.	I come tell dem sey, “ I dey give una bone bone, but I fit no get power again.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."	And e talk sey: “ The person wey dey vex well well well.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.	The truth be sey, na only two-tribe e dey. E get one time wey e take light shine.		0.00	0.00	18.00
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.	E get one time wey you dey drive for house. E get one small time wey you dey call 25 years.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.	Make I no forget wetin dey worry me for mind.                                    		0.00	0.00	45.00
You do it again and again.	You dey do am again.		0.00	0.00	5.00
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.	You fit use eight minublin take train their wedding. Na so e still be for America.		0.00	0.00	16.00
We set out to do this.	We dey do this one.		0.00	0.00	5.00
It took us 11 years to become operational.	E pass 11 years wey we take work well well.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.	We come talk sey we want go one place wey dem dey call Stephen.		0.00	0.00	14.00
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.	We get one special work wey we dey do for government and we dey use boat take care of people wey dey sleep.		0.00	0.00	23.00
We worked hard to get all the permissions.	We do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we dey praise Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.	After six month, we come enter one place wey dem dey call Kennem.		0.00	0.00	13.00
We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g.	We come tell dem sey make we go do the work wey we dey do, so that we no go stop am.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.	E fit be sey we go preach for three side.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.	E tell us why e want make we go.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And what he said, for me, was very moving.	And wetin dem talk, dem come make me go.		0.00	0.00	9.00
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...	E come talk sey: “ Earth be like sey, person wey get plenty money well well well.		0.00	0.00	17.00
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.	I dey think sey human being no get power to stay.		0.00	0.00	11.00
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."	So, I want make I dey encourage people.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.	E carry us go one place wey dem dey call Tennem, wey be Cenzero, wey be Cenzero for up.		0.00	0.00	19.00
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities -- who flew with us.	E get one time wey we get 150,000 people wey come from another place wey dem dey call professor wey dey call                                		0.00	0.00	53.00
We set up a whole ER.	We dey enjoy the whole world.		0.00	0.00	6.00
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.	We get four room wey im name na board, and two of dem dey jealousy.		0.00	0.00	15.00
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.	We dey respect the person wey dey do the blood of the blood of im blood.                                          		0.00	0.00	57.00
We had everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.	We don see everything wey we fit do to make sure sey God no treat us well.		0.00	0.00	17.00
We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle takes off and lands.	We dey fight for where Jehovah Witness people dey.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g.	E get one sister wey im name na Libert, wey im name na Libert, come carry me go meet am.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like.	If we dey there, we dey let am surprise us well well                                              		0.00	0.00	57.00
And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great.	The first thing be sey, you know sey na you first know everything.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So we did a second parabola.	Na im make we stay for one second oga.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.	We do one big fourth fourth fourth fth.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.	And this man no be like 65 years before e reach 65 years                                              		0.00	0.00	58.00
We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.	We dey stay for one place wey we dey call jealousy. We dey stay for one small house wey we dey stay.                                 		0.00	0.00	54.00
Please join us in this epic adventure.	Abeg, make we follow this advice.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And then when you say children, they will pretty quickly agree with you.	And when you dey talk to your pikin, dem go quick talk to you.		0.00	0.00	14.00
The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC, the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement.	For example, e get one place wey dem dey call Flawoz. E pass 40 years wey dem dey call Fidog. E pass 40 years wey dem dey call Fidog for one place wey dem dey call Fidog.		0.00	0.00	37.00
There are one billion children in the world, and 50 percent of them don't have electricity at home or at school.	For there, the two children for the whole world dey do things wey dem no like.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.	For some country, dem carry me go where dem dey call Anania for the school wey dem dey call Ambania for school.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And I don't mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.	I dey put mind for the small school wey dem dey call mifourth school for school.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype, it's gone from an idea to a real laptop.	Na im make for three years I dey talk about, and I believe sey one of this one na true.		0.00	0.00	20.00
We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children.	Today, we get two million million people for this world today.		0.00	0.00	11.00
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children, and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment.	We get some of our brothers and sisters wey dey work for this world. We don see other things wey we no suppose do before.		0.00	0.00	25.00
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.	Na im make for some million people no too plenty.		0.00	0.00	10.00
That's smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number.	I know sey small small small reach three million people. But I still see three million people wey dey                                       		0.00	0.00	57.00
In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.	For Colombia, we don pass 3,000 people wey dey work for there.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working, not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off, in which the people who had been causing, if you will, 40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived.	E get one time wey dem dey call Service Demefer Demetrip wey dem dey call Edad, wey dem dey call Edad, wey dem dey call Edad, wey dem dey call Edad, wey dem dey call Siberia.		0.00	0.00	36.00
And suddenly, the kids have connected laptops.	E just be like kidad wey                                                   		0.00	0.00	56.00
The change is absolutely monumental, because it's not just opening it up, but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.	The truth be sey, e no easy for everybody to change.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone, yes, there will be television.	So, e good make we dey build motor for television, television, wey dey                                       		0.00	0.00	51.00
But the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages, so the children grow up with access to information, with a window into the rest of the world.	But for six years, dem dey old pass six years wey dem dey call Internet, and the number of the whole world.		0.00	0.00	22.00
Interestingly enough, in other countries, it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth.	The truth be sey, for other country, dem go need to arrange other people wey go preach for another country.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.	And when we dey go, we dey see as better thing.		0.00	0.00	11.00
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year, but it's an important, deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children.	E no dey hard you to know before, but you no know sey the pikin no dey happy.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Thirty-one countries in total are involved, and in the case of Uruguay, half the children already have them, and by the middle of 2009, every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop.	E get one time wey dem go run go one place wey dem dey call Ugin, wey be Ugin-pikin, wey be Ugin, wey be Ugin-pikin, wey be Ugin-pikin, and wey be Ugay pikin.		0.00	0.00	33.00
Now what are some of the results?	now?		0.00	0.00	1.00
Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.	Some of our brothers and sisters wey don dey speak any language well talk sey dem no too get time to read for any matter wey concern God.		0.00	0.00	28.00
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents.	E fit be sey the pikin don dey teach im papa and mama well.                                           		0.00	0.00	56.00
They own the laptops.	Na only wetin dem dey do be that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother.	When I dey there with three children, I come dey travel from Botkinson wey dey stay for Bot                                  		0.00	0.00	51.00
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write.	The pikin wey im name na Michael and im mama born, dey read this book and how dem dey read am.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Her mother had not gone to primary school.	E no get any girl for school.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And this is such an inversion, and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change.	This one na better example of our children and their pikin.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops?	So now, people wey dey sing for meeting, which question dem dey talk about                                          		0.00	0.00	55.00
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods.	Lurter na one way wey dem take dey contribute.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The reason you want laptops is that the word is education, not laptop.	The main thing wey you want do na to prepare well well.		0.00	0.00	12.00
This is an education project, not a laptop project.	This one dey make sense.		0.00	0.00	5.00
They need to learn learning.	Dem need to learn how to learn more.		0.00	0.00	8.00
In a village, you have 100 laptops, each with a different set of 100 books, and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.	For one village, you get 100 village wey dem dey call each other. For there, you don get 100 small book wey dem print.		0.00	0.00	24.00
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.	E dey sweet me well well when I dey 10,000 years.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway.	Sometimes, na only small group dem dey use. Sometimes, na only small group dem dey print, or dem need to learn more things for school.		0.00	0.00	25.00
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."	So, no be only one time dem take dey do things like that.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program, and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free.	For one year, we get one ship wey dem dey call Suran. One day, we come dey carry 100,000 horse 100,000.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And by being a zero-dollar laptop, we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.	For example, we get one man wey im name na Julio. We fit travel go one place wey dem dey call radio.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And that's what we did.	And we come dey do things like that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Places that are not markets, seeding it with the principles of saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.	For example, if person no dey carry shoulder up, e fit be sey e no get sense to follow wetin Bible talk.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.	And as time dey go, e go hard us well well well.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.	E dey see the lair wey dey inside.		0.00	0.00	8.00
You don't vaccinate a few children.	Some of dem dey talk to dem.		0.00	0.00	7.00
You vaccinate all the children in an area.	E dey sweet you well well for the area.		0.00	0.00	9.00
So I thought, "I will talk about death."	So I think sey I go dey tell people about death.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Seemed to be the passion today.	Today, we dey fear to talk true.		0.00	0.00	7.00
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.	The truth be sey, e no easy for me to talk about wetin I dey talk. But I really want comot from where I dey stay.		0.00	0.00	26.00
That's what I want to talk about.	I know wetin I want do.		0.00	0.00	6.00
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, "Hi!	Na im make Bulun comot for where dem dey call Bildry. E no tey after e die, e come talk sey e go soon die.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer.	Dem carry me go one place wey dem dey call Galagoat, wey dem dey call Till Enoon, for where dem dey call Enoon, I dey call                    		0.00	0.00	45.00
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook.	And my papa comot from the book of the book of the book wey e write for Bible.		0.00	0.00	18.00
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.	For the last years wey e die, when e dey sick, e see book wey dey worry me for mind.		0.00	0.00	20.00
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.	E write about different different different different things wey I dey do. E talk about wetin I dey do. E sey: ‘ I dey use my life do good for me, and I dey sofri talk bad things.		0.00	0.00	38.00
After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.	After, I come see sey I no go ever leave me.		0.00	0.00	11.00
I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new?	But the truth be sey, e no easy for everybody to dey think like that.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?	Why e be like that?		0.00	0.00	5.00
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug.	E get one time wey I want stay for many years, I no too get money and property.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him.	But as I dey go, I dey read the letter give dem and I dey read am for my room and I dey read am together.		0.00	0.00	26.00
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one.	So make we no leave everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we get money and property.		0.00	0.00	19.00
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book, a soul-searching letter.	E dey sweet us well well to see book wey dem dey call pretend.		0.00	0.00	14.00
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes.	If we dey do this one, e fit be sey na only one of the paper wey John write. E fit be sey na only one of the one wey dem use take write for meeting, na one of our children.		0.00	0.00	41.00
So what do I plan to leave for my son?	So, wetin I go do to leave my pikin?		0.00	0.00	9.00
I collect autograph books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy.	I come use the book wey I dey give talk about the people wey come from another place. I know sey na you be the branch office for C                           		0.00	0.00	55.00

As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.	As I dey preach, I come see one fine way wey dem take dey fly for fire.		0.00	0.00	17.00
I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son.	I no think sey I go do this work. But I no think sey I go fit do am for my book dem.		0.00	0.00	23.00
I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation.	E dey sweet me well well when I dey tell dem wetin I go talk.		0.00	0.00	15.00

And besides, some of you might be wondering, what the hell does it mean?	(a) Wetin be some things wey you fit dey think about?		0.00	0.00	11.00
Let me begin with an example.	Make I come see one example.		0.00	0.00	6.00
This is the job description of a hospital janitor that is scrolling up on the screen.	Na im be the main work wey dem do for the two side of the scroll wey dey the                             		0.00	0.00	47.00
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.	Na im make everything dey happen.		0.00	0.00	6.00
It may be a little surprising how many things there are, but it's not surprising what they are.	E fit be sey many things no easy for many people to sing.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.	The work wey dem do dey make the work wey dem dey do before for hospital                                 		0.00	0.00	48.00
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like, they encountered Mike, who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor because Mr.	And when some of dem dey hospital, dem dey feel sey dem no get money or property. Dem fit dey think sey dem no happy for the work wey dem dey do.		0.00	0.00	32.00
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge because there were some family members who were there all day, every day who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.	Charenne come tell dem how e dey travel go visit different different place for there. E tell dem how e take dey preach for one day for one place wey dem dey call radium.		0.00	0.00	34.00
And then there was Luke, who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months, didn't see Luke do it the first time, and his father was angry.	E just be like sey, even though sey e no get pikin wey get cool temper, e get one room wey dem dey call sand sand sand sand sand before. E no tey, im papa pursue am comot from where dem dey call am		0.00	0.00	44.00
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well.	E be like sey the way dem take treat this kind people well, even if e dey hard dem to stay. E fit be because of this one, e fit be sey dem no get pikin, or even get plenty sickness.		0.00	0.00	41.00
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.	Now, all of us no be like that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness, care and empathy are an essential part of the job.	But the people wey dey serve Jehovah dey show sey dem get better character, and dem dey take care of dem.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.	But e still be sey dem no get any work wey dem write for Bible.		0.00	0.00	15.00
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.	This one no mean sey dem go do anything wey dem fit do to make                        		0.00	0.00	38.00
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.	Dem no go dey carry shoulder up.		0.00	0.00	7.00
Practical wisdom, Aristotle told us, "is the combination of moral will and moral skill."	As time dey go, dem come tell us the sense wey we go stay.		0.00	0.00	14.00
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.	Person wey get sense and wey get sense go dey make sure sey na im be the number one thing for im life.		0.00	0.00	23.00
A wise person knows how to improvise, as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.	E know sey person wey get sense go punish am well well. Na im make e know sey e no get sense at all.		0.00	0.00	24.00
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined and the context is always changing.	Many times, the problem wey we dey face no dey change.		0.00	0.00	11.00
A wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page, but dancing around them, inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.	Person wey get sense go dey use wayo collect things from people. But e go still show sey e get sense, even if e dey hard dem to choose wetin dem want do.		0.00	0.00	33.00
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills in the service of the right aims.	Person wey know where e suppose do reach go fit dey do the correct thing.		0.00	0.00	15.00
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.	To show sey people no dey support Jehovah work.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And finally, perhaps most important, a wise person is made, not born.	E fit be sey person no get sense.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Wisdom depends on experience, and not just any experience.	E no dey produce any problem wey person fit bear.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.	You need to know sey you need to know sey people wey dey pioneer well well.		0.00	0.00	16.00
You need permission to be allowed to improvise, try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.	You need to do everything wey you fit do so that you no go stop to serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.	You go need to teach your pikin well.		0.00	0.00	8.00
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience.	When you dey tell the people wey dey serve Jehovah, I dey ask dem how dem take dey do this work.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.	Dem no go need to find wetin dem go do. Dem go need to learn how to use                    		0.00	0.00	37.00
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.	E good make we learn how to take care of people.		0.00	0.00	11.00
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.	The good news dey your mind.		0.00	0.00	6.00
The bad news is that without wisdom, brilliance isn't enough.	The bad thing be sey, the person wey get sense no suppose get sense.		0.00	0.00	14.00
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.	E fit be sey you dey enjoy yourself with other people.		0.00	0.00	11.00
There's a sense in which it's obvious, and yet, let me tell you a little story.	The truth be sey, e get one time wey you take dey play wayo, and you                     		0.00	0.00	36.00

And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it, and called the police, who called an ambulance that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.

At that point, can the child go home?	E fit be sey the pikin go stay for house?		0.00	0.00	10.00

And, to be fair, rules are often imposed because previous officials have been lax and they let a child go back to an abusive household.	Many times, dem dey carry pikin go where dem dey stay because dem no get pikin.		0.00	0.00	16.00
When things go wrong, as of course they do, we reach for two tools to try to fix them.	Na so e still be for some of the bad things wey dem dey do for dem                      		0.00	0.00	38.00
One tool we reach for is rules.	One thing be sey, we no dey carry shoulder.		0.00	0.00	9.00

Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...	The truth be sey, e get many things wey people dey do.		0.00	0.00	12.00
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives are enough to do the job.	The truth be sey, the truth no be just to find work.		0.00	0.00	12.00
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?	How you fit even write am?		0.00	0.00	6.00
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?	And you go pay dem for mind sey we go pay dem?		0.00	0.00	12.00
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules, rules and incentives may make things better in the short run, but they create a downward spiral that makes them worse in the long run.	E dey sweet us well well as we dey try to make sure sey we get better character, but we fit even dey quick settle the matter well.		0.00	0.00	28.00
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations.	Na so e still be for person to comot hand from things wey fit make us stop to serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And moral will is undermined by an incessant appeal to incentives that destroy our desire to do the right thing.	(1 Cor. 13: 1-5) If we want be like that, e go make us no do wetin we want.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And without intending it, by appealing to rules and incentives, we are engaging in a war on wisdom.	If we no dey carry shoulder up, e go show sey we get sense and we no dey carry shoulder up.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Let me just give you a few examples, first of rules and the war on moral skill.	Make I just be like some example of the example of people wey dey rule for war.		0.00	0.00	17.00

If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it.	If you dey do something like that, e fit be sey you no get any other thing wey happen to you before.		0.00	0.00	22.00

What happens is that the second this introduction of incentive gets us so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"	The second thing be sey, the second thing wey we dey do dey make us stop to dey ask ourself sey, ‘ Wetin be the second thing wey I dey do?            		0.00	0.00	42.00

People are inspired by moral heroes.	God use im spirit take explain am.		0.00	0.00	7.00
But we learn that with sophistication comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.	But we still learn from the things wey dey make person believe sey na im be the main                            		0.00	0.00	45.00

Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.	E talk about one woman wey im name na Williin-mathea. E get one                          		0.00	0.00	38.00
Because it took the will to do the right thing.	Because of the right to do wetin e want.		0.00	0.00	9.00
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.	E know sey God know am well well.		0.00	0.00	8.00
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know in order to plot this out.	E just be like sey e want know how e dey do things.		0.00	0.00	13.00
But most important to make it work -- and he emphasized this -- is that it took knowing the people in the communities.	But many people wey dey work for there dey tell people why e be like that.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Unless the people you're working with are behind you, this will fail.	E no go easy for people to work with you.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you, because different people in different communities organize their lives in different ways.	You dey there to tell people how you go take tell people how you go take do their work.		0.00	0.00	19.00
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.	Na so e still be for one place wey dem dey call EY                                		0.00	0.00	44.00
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.	You don see am as person wey get hot charcoal.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.	For example, e get one man wey im name na aninju.		0.00	0.00	11.00
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.	If we dey do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no dey do like that.		0.00	0.00	19.00
As heads of organizations, we should strive to create environments that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.	As people wey dey serve Jehovah dey try to make sure sey we dey do things wey go make people vex.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people will give up if they have to swim against the current in the organizations in which they work.	Even if e no easy for people to comot hand from fake religion hand, e go make dem no join the work wey dem dey do.		0.00	0.00	26.00
If you run an organization, you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.	If you dey run from another country, you go know sey na one of the work wey you dey do for the work wey you dey do for work.		0.00	0.00	29.00
Because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work.	Because the truth be sey, you dey do everything wey you fit do to support Jehovah work.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.	If we no dey do this one, we no go get any sense wey we go get.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And, perhaps most important, as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes, the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.	E good make we dey teach people the truth wey dey Bible.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.	E get some things wey we fit remember as we dey teach our children.		0.00	0.00	14.00
One is that we are always teaching.	One thing be sey, we dey always teach people the truth wey dey Bible.		0.00	0.00	14.00

That is that they have come to the realization that the single most important thing kids need to learn is character.	This one dey make dem happy well well well.		0.00	0.00	9.00
They need to learn to respect themselves.	Dem need to dey respect dem.		0.00	0.00	6.00
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.	Dem need to learn how to take care of their classmate.		0.00	0.00	11.00
They need to learn to respect their teachers.	Dem need to learn how to teach their pikin.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.	And many of dem need to learn more.		0.00	0.00	8.00
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.	If you see sey the rest well well, you go just sitdown ontop the wood.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And I think he was right.	And na wetin happen to me be that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom, because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on -- to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.	And we need to think about how we go take get the sense wey other people get, because of the kind sense wey dem suppose get, and the right to do good thing.		0.00	0.00	33.00
I think there is reason for hope.	I dey think like that.		0.00	0.00	5.00
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.	I dey think sey I go need person to kill another person.		0.00	0.00	12.00
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.	Many people dey like to do wetin dem want.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Wanting to do the right thing in the right way for the right reasons.	E good make we do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no do am.		0.00	0.00	18.00
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention.	This one dey make our mind come down.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Paying attention to what we do, to how we do it, and, perhaps most importantly, to the structure of the organizations within which we work, so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom rather than having it suppressed.	If we dey think about wetin we go do, how we go take do am, and how we fit do am? We fit still show sey we get the kind work wey we go do to make sure sey we get the kind money wey people get, or the money wey we go get   		0.00	0.00	56.00

On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.	E get one bird wey we get.		0.00	0.00	7.00
All these things are important for development, especially when you just get out of poverty and you should go towards welfare.	The truth be sey, e get one time wey you go get that kind sickness wey you suppose get.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Now, what we need to think about is, what is a goal for development, and what are the means for development?	So, wetin we need to think about, and wetin we go gain?		0.00	0.00	12.00
Let me first grade what are the most important means.	Make I first think about wetin e mean.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor, is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival.	This one dey make me happy well well well.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Governance.	All of us dey make mistake.		0.00	0.00	6.00

Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.	Heth na one better thing.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.	E get one man wey get right to cross.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Now what about goals?	now?		0.00	0.00	1.00
We are not interested in money.	We no want make money or property.		0.00	0.00	7.00
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.	I really need to put mind for the work.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing, but it's not a goal.	Na true sey all of us dey work well, but e no easy for dem.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.	E no go tey, the school wey dem dey call proko no mean sey the pikin dey come.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Health I give two points.	Heth name na Heth.		0.00	0.00	4.00
And that's good, it gets two plusses.	And na two of dem dey do good things.		0.00	0.00	9.00
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.	Na that one make you no use your sense take save you.		0.00	0.00	12.00
But where are the important goals?	But if you plan wetin you want use your life do for Jehovah?		0.00	0.00	13.00
Human rights is the goal, but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.	E get one man wey get cool temper. But the man no mean sey e no go get belle.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And culture.	And different place dey.		0.00	0.00	4.00
So the seemingly impossible is possible.	So, make we no think sey we fit do am                                          		0.00	0.00	51.00
Even African countries can achieve this.	Even after that one, e fit no easy for us to do this work.		0.00	0.00	14.00

We can have a good world.	Na good thing we fit do.		0.00	0.00	6.00

What we do is we accelerate protons -- so, hydrogen nuclei -- around 99.999999 percent the speed of light.	E good make we dey put eye for things wey concern God.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Right?	Real life?		0.00	0.00	2.00
And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction.	And we still dey use one of dem.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We collide them inside giant detectors.	We come see dem from one of dem.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.	And na wetin I dey do be that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
You get some sense of the size -- you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath.	E get some things wey you fit do to know this kind people.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector -- immense numbers.	(1 Pet. 3: 1-4) And before we born this earth, we get am for mind sey na around 600 million people start to rule for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	28.00
And if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles, so it can measure how fast they're traveling.	If you see sey this kind thing don happen to you before, you go see sey people fit enter trouble.		0.00	0.00	20.00
This is a picture about a year ago.	This picture na one year for one year.		0.00	0.00	8.00

And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created, sometime in the summer this year.	The people wey dey do this one show sey dem no get sense.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And actually, this morning, I got an email saying that we've just finished, today, building the last piece of ATLAS.	For morning, I enter one morning, I come see sey no be only last days I take build the temple.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So as of today, it's finished.	Na so e still be today.		0.00	0.00	6.00
So, you might be asking, "Why?	So, you fit dey ask yourself sey, ‘ Why?		0.00	0.00	9.00
Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"	Why? Because of the sin wey dey our body, wetin make am clear sey na im be the second oga of heaven and earth?		0.00	0.00	24.00
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.	People wey dey serve Jehovah fit dey cause trouble.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.	The truth be sey, e dey hard us to understand wetin we dey learn, and how to understand everything.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And by everything I mean, of course, me and you, the Earth, the Sun, the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe.	The truth be sey, all of us na me, and Eaxr, the Inxr, the Exr, and the Inxillion.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Now you might say, "Well, OK, but why not just look at it?	But now, you fit talk sey e no easy for you to look?                                                    		0.00	0.00	64.00
You know?	You know?		0.00	0.00	2.00
Well, we found that as you look back in time, the universe gets hotter and hotter, denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.	The truth be sey, as time dey go, you dey look things well well, and you see am as person wey dey mold.		0.00	0.00	23.00
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that, but that seems to be the case.	Now, e no get any reason why e be like that.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So, way back in the early times of the universe, we believe it was very simple and understandable.	Na im make for the whole world, we believe sey we fit believe everything and we believe am well well.		0.00	0.00	20.00
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe.	All this things na part of the better things wey person fit do to get money and property.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second, we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.	The first thing wey happen for Bilbilbica na the first one wey we talk about. We know sey we get simple simple simple                                     		0.00	0.00	59.00
imagine a snowflake in your hand, and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated, beautiful object.	You think sey you no fit see am as you dey waka for ground, and you dey look am well well.		0.00	0.00	21.00
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of.	So make we no forget sey the time wey we take dey know wetin Jehovah get for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And, as of today, it's made of these things.	Today, we dey do things like that.		0.00	0.00	7.00
Just 12 particles of matter, stuck together by four forces of nature.	When we dey 12 years, we dey see four things wey fit make us vex.		0.00	0.00	15.00
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.	The main thing be sey, dem dey plan wetin dem go do to make sure sey dem no put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye.		0.00	0.00	29.00
The electron -- the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus -- held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force that's carried by this thing, the photon.	The truth be sey, the things wey we dey do for this world just be like sey na only one of the things wey we dey do for this world.		0.00	0.00	30.00
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.	Dem dey arrange things together so that dem go dey do things together                                                      		0.00	0.00	66.00
And these guys, here, they're the weak nuclear force, probably the least familiar.	The truth be sey, for this world, we know sey to train pikin well well, we need to get strong faith.		0.00	0.00	21.00
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.	But the sun no be like sun.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.	When sun dey fall, e mean sey you no dey put hand for politics matter.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun, passing through every square centimeter of your body.	E fit be sey you dey look your motor well well. E fit be sey na only you dey look for inside the bird wey dey fly for up. E fit be sey your bird dey spoil the bird wey dey fly.		0.00	0.00	42.00
But you don't feel them, because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak, so they just fly through you.	But the way dem dey dress dey make dem strong, na im make dem strong pass.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And these particles have been discovered over the last century, pretty much.	For this last days, many people for apostle time don plenty well well well.		0.00	0.00	14.00
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino, in the year 2000.	The first thing be sey, the first thing wey dem do for 1897 na for one year 97, dem carry am go the war.		0.00	0.00	24.00
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.	Na im make everything wey e do be that.		0.00	0.00	9.00
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find, is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.	One of dem wey get better things wey dem dey do for dem, don see sey dem no know you.		0.00	0.00	20.00
You know, they're a step in size from the entire observable universe.	You know sey this one na part of heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So, 100 billion galaxies, 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey, actually, is about the same as from Monterey to these things.	So, e get one billion wey im name na Milbillion, wey be Monxillion. E pass 13.7 years wey dem dey call Mon’s 1997.		0.00	0.00	23.00
Absolutely, exquisitely minute, and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.	Dem come dey respect the person wey dey carry shoulder up. Dem come dey use all their power do                                               		0.00	0.00	65.00
So, one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford, discoverer of the atomic nucleus, once said, "All science is either physics or stamp collecting."	Na im make for one of the place wey dem dey call Mester Mester Mester Mester Mester Mester Mester Mester, wey we dey call Esadneck, wey dey call Estation, wey dem dey call Irdnezast.		0.00	0.00	34.00
Now, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.	Now, I dey think about how e dey dress, and e dey hungry many people to change.		0.00	0.00	17.00
OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is -- really you've done stamp collecting.	KK am sey you no know everything wey you fit do, but you no know why e be like sey na only you dey use all your mind serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	30.00
Fortunately, we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern.	This one go make us no think sey we better pass other people wey dey serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	17.00
It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics.	E dey hard you to follow the law wey dey Bible.		0.00	0.00	11.00
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.	The truth be sey, dem no go fit count am.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt, which is always the sign of elegance.	You fit stand for front of one place wey dem dey call another person.		0.00	0.00	14.00
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.	But the truth be sey, you dey waka pass any other thing wey you don do for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle, you've got a big enough computer -- why DNA is the shape it is.	So, you want know why e good to dey talk to one man wey im name na Disi, wey im name na Discil.		0.00	0.00	23.00
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.	If you follow this advice, you go fit                                                          		0.00	0.00	65.00
Can anyone see what it is?	What of you?		0.00	0.00	3.00
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.	Another thing be sey, all of us get sin for body.		0.00	0.00	11.00
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.	The truth be sey, e no easy for person to carry shoulder up.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Basically, each of these terms refers to some of the particles.	Dem no even dey talk about this matter.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.	So, dem no dey talk to people wey no be Want, and how dem dey                                                 		0.00	0.00	63.00
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.	Dem dey carry body down, so that dem go fit do the same thing.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Higgs particles have not been discovered.	E don tey wey dem dey call Hycliffe.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.	So, make we no take am play with am. So make we no take am play with dem.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.	E get one time wey we go meet people wey dey work for am.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government, Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said, "If you guys can explain, in language a politician can understand, what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.	E get one time wey we want stay for 198000,000 money wey dem dey call Hout, wey dey call Margaret, wey be politician, wey be politician, wey be politician, wey be politician, wey be politician.		0.00	0.00	35.00
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."	I want know wetin happen to Brother Higi.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.	And we come see am sey we come dey do the work wey dem dey                                              		0.00	0.00	60.00
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.	The way dem take dey work na to arrange things well.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.	The picture of heaven and earth na one of heaven and earth. E mean sey na im be the God wey high pass for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	27.00
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.	The man wey im name na Hanaist Hughes Hughes.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Now when a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles.	Many times, when Jesus dey this earth, e fit be sey na im be the Person wey get power pass.		0.00	0.00	20.00
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.	But you think sey person wey no be Jew no know who dem be.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Then everyone ignores them.	Na true sey everybody dey see dem.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room.	You think sey e go hard person to sitdown think about wetin dem dey talk.		0.00	0.00	15.00
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.	Dem come see the motor for the room wey dem dey call the room.		0.00	0.00	14.00
It's almost like they get heavy.	Dem come dey look dem well.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.	E just be like sey the way person take dey arrange things well.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy, in a sense, and massive, because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.	The picture of the book wey we write for Bible dey help us know wetin we suppose do and wetin we fit do to make sure sey we get sense.		0.00	0.00	30.00
They're interacting with the Higgs field.	Them de Do the good news.		0.00	0.00	6.00
If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.	If we get this one for mind, we don see sey the people wey we dey preach well well.		0.00	0.00	19.00
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC.	If we do this one, e no go hard us to find work. E fit be sey the money wey we dey spend pass the money wey we dey spend pass na Rico.		0.00	0.00	33.00
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.	So make we no take am play.		0.00	0.00	7.00
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.	You dey happy sey you see Margaret Tcher Trock.		0.00	0.00	9.00
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.	The truth be sey, dem no go fit count wetin happen.		0.00	0.00	11.00
There are many other things.	E get many things wey dey happen.		0.00	0.00	7.00
There's another issue, which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually -- seem, as you go back in time, they seem to change in strength.	This one go make dem change.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Well, they do change in strength.	Dem dey try to change.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together, gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.	So, make we no let anything make us stop to dey do things together.		0.00	0.00	14.00
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker.	The strong faith wey dem get na strong strong strong strong pass.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.	E get one time wey something dey happen.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.	Many times, dem dey waka for one place wey dem dey call bush. Dem dey try well well well so that dem no go put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye.		0.00	0.00	35.00
But actually, with this theory, we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy.	But as we dey go, we see am sey we no dey play wayo.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Also, those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter.	Dem dey arrange things well well for the place wey dem dey call cancer.		0.00	0.00	14.00
So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics.	Na im make for person to dey look things well.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC.	And if I dey put money, I go put hand for the money wey dem dey call Hushap.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Many other things that the LHC could discover.	Many of this things don happen to many people before.		0.00	0.00	10.00
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.	But for the last minutes, I want make I wear different-different character wey I dey wear, so that I no go just dey think about wetin I dey talk.		0.00	0.00	29.00
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story, if you'd like -- about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.	For last years, I dey think sey we better pass other things wey dey happen for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.	Dem dey call Wavine Wavin the Davin, wey dey work for Bethel, dey bring plenty money and property well well.		0.00	0.00	20.00
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.	Na the things wey I dey learn be that.		0.00	0.00	9.00
It began to expand about a million, billion, billion, billion billionth of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.	E come be like bilbilbilbilba, wey be the bilate of the right wey e get. After, I come dey think sey I no get right to think sey                   		0.00	0.00	46.00
Gravity separated away from the other forces.	This one mean sey dem go comot from where dem dey stay.		0.00	0.00	12.00
The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation.	Na im make am clear sey na Jehovah make everything.		0.00	0.00	10.00
In about the first billionth of a second or so, the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass.	For example, the first man wey im name na Honinal Hica Hicgica Hica Hica Hica talk sey make we do more work, so that we go fit do am.		0.00	0.00	29.00
The universe continued to expand and cool.	Na im make everything continue to fight and na im make everything.		0.00	0.00	12.00
After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe.	After some minumber one, dem come dey lie lie for heaven and earth.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium.	The way Jehovah take arrange everything wey e dey do, na around 25 years e arrange.		0.00	0.00	16.00
It continued to expand about 300 million years.	Na 300 years e pass and e pass 300 million.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Then light began to travel through the universe.	E come start to travel go heaven.		0.00	0.00	7.00
It was big enough to be transparent to light, and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God.	E just be like sey many papa and mama no fit see anything wey we fit do to see the fine fine fine fine fine stone wey dem dey call Sister for George                      		0.00	0.00	54.00
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed, and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook into the heavier elements.	After 400 years wey we don pass, the first 400 C.E., the first 400 C.E.		0.00	0.00	15.00
So the elements of life -- carbon, and oxygen and iron, all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars, which then ran out of fuel, exploded, threw those elements back into the universe.	So, the way we take dey live our life take different from the sun, and the first thing wey we need, na so e still be for the first heat of the whole world.		0.00	0.00	34.00
They then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets.	As time dey go, dem come dey waka near each other well well and                                           		0.00	0.00	56.00
And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen to form water, liquid water on the surface.	The first thing be sey, the number of the stars na the first plane wey we take dey fly with water.		0.00	0.00	21.00
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world.	E fit be sey na only one of the things wey dey happen for the whole world. E fit be sey na only three years dem take write all the things wey dem dey do for the whole world.		0.00	0.00	39.00
And built this civilization, this wonderful picture, that turned the darkness into light, and you can see the civilization from space.	This one come make dem near each other well well.		0.00	0.00	10.00
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said, these are the things -- and actually, not only these, but I was looking around -- these are the things, like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik, and DNA, and literature and science -- these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years.	As e be like sey I never reach where I dey call Sakarl, one of the things wey dem dey call Sakniben, wey dem dey call Nróniben-S.7 bulton, and Nrónife.		0.00	0.00	30.00
And, the laws of physics.	And the laws de help us.		0.00	0.00	6.00
So, the right laws of physics -- they're beautifully balanced.	Na im make the law wey dey Bible dey talk about.		0.00	0.00	11.00
If the weak force had been a little bit different, then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars, and there would be none of that in the universe.	If to sey the stars big well well, e fit be sey the bird wey dey fly for up and e fit be sey the stars dey for heaven and earth no dey again.		0.00	0.00	34.00
And I think that's a wonderful and significant story.	I come dey think sey I better pass other things.		0.00	0.00	10.00
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story, because we didn't know it.	50 years now, my husband and wife tell us sey we don get chance to know because we know sey we                                    		0.00	0.00	56.00
It makes me really feel that that civilization -- which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics, and a few hydrogen atoms -- then I think, to me anyway, it makes me feel incredibly valuable.	E dey make me believe sey if I dey serve Jehovah well, I dey tell una some things wey dey make person believe sey wetin e talk na true, I believe sey wetin I dey talk na true or wetin fit cause am.		0.00	0.00	43.00
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer, going to write the next chapter of that book.	The second thing wey happen for Bible time be sey, when the next time reach, the next book                                      		0.00	0.00	55.00
And I'm certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on.	E dey hungry many people to do good things.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Any of you get really freaked out by that?	Any better thing wey you fit do                                                  		0.00	0.00	56.00
You might want to leave now.	You fit leave you now.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And over the past few days, many of you have been asking me, "How did you come to this?	E don tey wey you don dey ask you sey, ‘ How you don take do this work?		0.00	0.00	18.00
And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.	E just be like sey, as time dey go, many people dey laugh you.		0.00	0.00	14.00
About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess.	Na around 10 years I dey go preach for one place wey dem dey call oil. For some years, I dey stay with one big house and e dey stay there for there.		0.00	0.00	33.00
And he was telling me that really, we ought to try and eradicate these things.	And e dey tell me sey make we dey try well well, and we no want make anything happen.		0.00	0.00	19.00
We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.	We dey gather together because of this one.		0.00	0.00	8.00
I said that was stupid, you know, maybe we should just train them to do something useful.	I come tell dem sey make we dey train dem, but make we no                                           		0.00	0.00	56.00
And he said that was impossible.	And e talk sey e no fit change.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.	E get one man wey im name na Iony. E get one brother wey im name na Iva wey im name na Ipastor.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.	Na im make I still dey read the next years wey I dey read for our book dem.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.	But the part of the way I take know sey I don see sey I don really know sey na people wey don dey hungry to change.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.	E get one time wey e go tell people about religion, and some people wey don die tey tey tey tey before e reach                                 		0.00	0.00	56.00
And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.	I come dey look dem as king.		0.00	0.00	7.00
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.	E just be like sey we dey stay together.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.	We come go back to all of us.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.	Na so e still be for us today.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.	Na im make all of us need to encourage each other.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.	For example, we fit talk sey we no dey do like that.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.	E fit be sey person no know who e be. E no want make person dey laugh person, but e need to control imself from that one.		0.00	0.00	27.00
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.	So, I come dey think sey I no go fit do anything wey dem fit do.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.	The truth be sey, we fit come see some things wey we fit do to make sure sey we be Jehovah friend.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And so I built the vending machine.	Na so I take build the machine.		0.00	0.00	7.00
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.	But the story of the story of the farmer show sey you value am.		0.00	0.00	14.00
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.	E go don tey wey person go cross this earth, and e go really happy well well well.		0.00	0.00	18.00
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.	Dem come see one place wey dem dey call Aricton Aricton and e dey stay for South America.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.	The truth be sey, e no easy for everybody to fit preach like this before.		0.00	0.00	15.00
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.	So we fit dey think about dem, but we fit dey always remember dem.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.	E no surprise us sey this kind thing don happen to human being now.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.	For there, we dey choose nine side of people wey dey there.		0.00	0.00	12.00
We're seeing a population boom with crows.	E just be like sey the people wey dey work well well well.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.	So, we fit talk sey we no go want make people wey dey serve Jehovah well.		0.00	0.00	16.00
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.	But I really know wetin dem want do to show sey I like the bird wey dem dey call cancer.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And I'll give you an example of that.	And make you dey tell dem better example.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So this is Betty.	Na im make this Bethelite.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.	The crown wey dem build for wilderness no be small.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.	E fit be sey e no easy for person to dey                          		0.00	0.00	36.00
But the researchers had a problem.	But as time dey go, e dey hard dem to comot.		0.00	0.00	11.00
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.	Dem come comot from where dem dey stay.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.	E come dey fear to do this one.		0.00	0.00	8.00
You see, it wasn't working very well.	You dey see am as person wey dey work well well.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Now this is completely unprompted.	But now, this one no mean sey the pikin don die.		0.00	0.00	11.00
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.	Nothing come tell am sey make e go back to life.		0.00	0.00	11.00
But she did it all on her own.	But e no gree.		0.00	0.00	4.00
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.	So make we no forget sey this one no happen.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.	The truth be sey, dem go need to put eye for things wey go make their life better.		0.00	0.00	18.00
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.	For there, all of us get different different book wey dem dey call pretend.		0.00	0.00	14.00
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.	For example, for Swedding day, people go wait make dem wait for one chop.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.	And when the people start to enter the farm, the cross enter the fish, the fish, or the ashbag.		0.00	0.00	19.00
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.	E just be like sey the people wey dey work well well.		0.00	0.00	12.00
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.	For example, e get one time wey dem dey call Washer Washer Washer Washer, wey come from Washer.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.	Some of dem come go cross the cross wey dem give dem, cross dem well well, and dem no waste time do am again.		0.00	0.00	24.00
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.	Dem come carry am go where dem dey stay for inside the rest week. Na this one make am surprise us well well well.		0.00	0.00	24.00
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.	Dem no waste time before this one happen.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And the next month.	The next month, the next month.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.	Before dem finish, dem come carry us go where dem dey call Iff and Ida. Later, dem come carry us go back go meet dem for back.		0.00	0.00	27.00
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.	Na im make for person to buy something.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.	So now, the Bible Student for Washer Washer Washers come dey do this work so that dem go fit do this big big big big big		0.00	0.00	26.00
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.	So, we know sey this cross dey bring more people come life again, but I don see am sey I don see more more.		0.00	0.00	24.00
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.	E get one problem wey dem dey call cancer.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.	Make we no stop to dey wear the light wey people de wear.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.	E fit be sey you get cool body.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.	Na im make many people dey talk about this matter.		0.00	0.00	10.00
In fact, that's old hat for crows.	The truth be sey, e no easy for person to crown.		0.00	0.00	11.00
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.	E get one time wey dem dey call Senndai Sennachi for one school wey dem dey call Sennuri.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.	Since that time, all of us don cross the people wey dey work for this area dey treat stranger well.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.	And now, the cross wey dem build for five kilorepair the motor.		0.00	0.00	12.00
So, they're learning from each other.	So, e good make we learn from each other.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Parents seem to be teaching their young.	Papa and mama be like sey dem dey teach their pikin.		0.00	0.00	11.00
They've learned from their peers.	Dem come see sey dem fine well well.		0.00	0.00	8.00
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.	If I dey small, I dey tell dem sey make I give dem chance to crown.		0.00	0.00	16.00
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.	The truth be sey, the people wey dey speak different language well well.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.	We dey hear as one day wey we dey call Pandlorado for the box wey dem dey call Psalukata, and where we dey stay.		0.00	0.00	24.00
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.	E dey hard you to run go the place wey dem dey use.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So we know that there's lots of crows.	So we know sey we go cross the crown.		0.00	0.00	9.00
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.	We know sey if we dey carry body up, we dey see each other.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.	When I see this one, I come see sey na only small thing I go do.		0.00	0.00	16.00
This is a vending machine for crows.	Na so e still be for person to cross the                          		0.00	0.00	35.00
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.	And make we dey use one of our book dem.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.	But as time dey go, we dey put eye for the work wey we dey do for the place wey we dey use.		0.00	0.00	23.00
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.	The crown wey dem plant dey chop, and dem dey chop the machine wey dey                   		0.00	0.00	33.00
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.	Dem come dey chop the stone.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.	Dem come see sey dem no need person wey go help dem.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.	And after that time, dem leave the machine wey dem dey use cow, get plenty money and property.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.	You fit come back to your house and you fit no see am again.                                         		0.00	0.00	54.00
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.	So, when we dey go, we come see sey we don ready to cross the crown.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.	Now, dem dey drive the motor well well, and dem dey bring plenty coins. Dem dey buy am for inside water wey dem dey call cancard.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.	And when we dey do this one, e go make us happy.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.	And na only when we dey travel, we dey give dem chance to get cool.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.	But now, many of us don use better word wey good for us.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.	So, dem dey look wetin dem dey do when dem see something wey fit make dem no cry.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.	Dem do wetin dem fit do, so that dem no go happy, and dem go happy well well well when dem                                 		0.00	0.00	53.00
And so this goes on for some time.	Na so e still be for some time.		0.00	0.00	8.00
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.	Dem ready to wait for everything wey dem fit do to show sey dem ready to wait for the better thing wey dem do for dem.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.	The last one wey better pass be sey, when we get money and property, e dey make us happy.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.	And we dey see the kind cross wey the animals and other sheep                                         		0.00	0.00	53.00
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.	For example, for example, e go show sey e get sense.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.	For back, I dey look for the place wey dem dey call call                                          		0.00	0.00	54.00
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.	Dem fit still get one time wey dem dey call razen before dem stop. Dem fit pay tax, and dem ready to do this work.                          		0.00	0.00	50.00
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.	Crows come dey clean for hand, and dem dey try well well.		0.00	0.00	12.00
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.	Dem know sey this kind thing dey happen to dem.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.	So, dem no come dey blow, and dem no waste time do am.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.	E get one time wey dem go cross wey dem dey call Hister. E no tey, dem dey call Heeting of clay pole wey dem dey call Hister. Dem dey call Hhobay, and dem dey waka ontop water.		0.00	0.00	38.00
And then, we're off to the races.	And as e be, e dey hard dem to comot.		0.00	0.00	10.00
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.	Na im make am hard for us to find better cloth wey im friend go do for there until e come.		0.00	0.00	21.00
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.	So make we no take am like that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.	E get one time wey I dey stay for 216 million people wey never change. But now, I dey sure sey I no fit change my life.		0.00	0.00	27.00
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger.	Instead, I go think sey I no go fit see any small pikin.		0.00	0.00	13.00
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.	I dey think sey I go need to train other things.		0.00	0.00	11.00
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?	For example, e no good make we train dem to know why e be like that?		0.00	0.00	16.00
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?	Or e get any other things wey we fit do to make sure sey we no do am?		0.00	0.00	18.00
Or maybe do search and rescue?	Or e fit dey hard you to see person wey don die?		0.00	0.00	12.00
The main thing, the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.	The main thing be sey, the main thing wey we fit do so that we fit see sey na Jehovah Witness people dey.		0.00	0.00	23.00
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.	We fit see other things wey happen for the beginning of the book wey dem dey call pretend, but e fit be sey the person no know wetin e suppose do.		0.00	0.00	31.00
I'd collected -- I was a collector, major, big-time.	I dey spend time with plenty people.		0.00	0.00	7.00
I just looked at it, and I didn't know what to do.	I just dey look am well, and I just know wetin I suppose do.		0.00	0.00	14.00
I mean, this was -- was I my things?	I believe sey this things na true?		0.00	0.00	7.00
I always live in the present -- I love the present.	I dey always do the work wey I dey do for the last world.                                         		0.00	0.00	54.00
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid, like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.	E teach me some things wey go make dem do good things.		0.00	0.00	12.00

Well, how many words do I get this time?	How I take dey explain am?		0.00	0.00	6.00
Doctor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"	Doctor Sistcian na one man wey dey stay for synaked people?		0.00	0.00	11.00
We'd better give you a real sound bite.	E dey sweet you well well.		0.00	0.00	6.00
This time you can have three words.	This one fit make you talk about three things wey dey Bible                                            		0.00	0.00	55.00
Professor Seligman, what is the state of psychology today?"	For example, one man wey im name na Synelius, dey push am to stay?		0.00	0.00	14.00
Not good enough.	E good make we try well.		0.00	0.00	6.00
I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.	I want tell am why e be sey, for many years, I go tell am why e no good to go, and how                              		0.00	0.00	52.00
And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.	When I dey carry shoulder up, I no want make I dey watch film or film, I dey like the way I dey think.		0.00	0.00	24.00
Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.	E pass 60 years wey pass 60 years, and e pass 60 years.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me.	When I reach Ten years, I come tell myself sey I go quick comot from where I dey stay. I come tell dem wetin I go do.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you.	Dem come tell dem sey make dem kill you because dem no like where dem dey.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.	And now, when I dey tell people wetin I go do, dem dey help me.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And what was good about psychology, about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology, is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors.	For example, e get one man wey im name na Mildad. E get one man wey im name na Mister Meroz, wey dey call Irónife. E get one sickness wey dem dey call Irónife.		0.00	0.00	34.00
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.	And now, na two of dem dey fight.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness.	E still talk sey science person fit change im life.		0.00	0.00	10.00
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor.	This one come make us know sey we fit no like people wey dey work for other place.		0.00	0.00	18.00
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.	This one go make us fit talk true true, but we fit talk true.		0.00	0.00	14.00
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.	This one go help us understand the truth wey dey Bible.		0.00	0.00	11.00
We could look across time at the same people -- people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.	For example, we fit see sey people wey dey serve God well. We fit still see the same example of people wey no get sense and wey dem fit trust.		0.00	0.00	30.00
And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.	E get one time wey we go stay for last years, and we dey gather together for three years.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random assignment, placebo controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.	We come dey carry dem go where dem dey stay because of work wey dem dey do for Jehovah organization, or e dey bring plenty money.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years, can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.	The truth be sey, for last days, many people dey laugh us well well. And we know sey the last years wey we dey stay for last days, we fit no know sey                  		0.00	0.00	50.00
And I think that's terrific.	And I dey think like that.		0.00	0.00	6.00
But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.	But wetin happen be that.		0.00	0.00	5.00
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.	The first thing be sey, the first time wey you go stay for house, na when you first see person wey don die. E fit be sey you no know sey the person go pay tax collector.		0.00	0.00	37.00
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.	And we come choose sey we go choose wetin we go do.		0.00	0.00	12.00
We forgot responsibility.	We come dey drive.		0.00	0.00	4.00
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.	The second thing pain us well well.		0.00	0.00	7.00
We forgot about improving normal lives.	We come dey carry body down.		0.00	0.00	6.00
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive.	We come dey try to preach to people wey no be Jehovah Witness.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.	The third problem wey we get no fit make us sick, fit make us no do anything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no do anything wey we fit do so that we no go do the bad thing wey we go do.		0.00	0.00	46.00
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.	Na so e still be for some people wey dey work for Nanton, wey come from Zaniti, wey dey Caribi, talk sey: ‘ I no gree sey I go do any work wey dem want do for where dem dey call Midry.		0.00	0.00	42.00
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.	The first thing be sey, the first thing wey person suppose get for mind na to carry body down.		0.00	0.00	19.00
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.	E good make we dey think about how to carry body down.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It should be interested in the best things in life.	E good make we dey think like that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.	And make we dey think about how we go take live the kind life wey people dey contribute.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.	Na im make for last years, Bible talk sey people wey don die go come life again for many years.		0.00	0.00	20.00
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.	The truth be sey, when we dey do things, e go make us happy.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And any of you, for free, can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.	If you dey free for any side, you go need to use our website and other things wey go make you                                     		0.00	0.00	57.00
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?	You fit ask yourself, wetin you fit do to make your mind come down?		0.00	0.00	14.00
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.	We come see sey we fit dey use all our mind do things wey go make Jehovah happy. And we still see sey we no need to dey do things wey go make us happy.                      		0.00	0.00	56.00
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question, how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?	E get one time wey I dey work well well, and e dey hard me to ask people how to treat people well.		0.00	0.00	23.00
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.	For example, around six years wey we dey go, we come tell other people about Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And how do they differ from the rest of us?	And how dem take different from other people example?                                                 		0.00	0.00	57.00
And it turns out there's one way.	Another thing be sey, when person dey talk to each other, e go dey                                           		0.00	0.00	56.00
They're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events.	E no easy for dem to fight, but dem no need to find better money or property well. Dem fit even dey think sey dem no need money to get better money.		0.00	0.00	32.00
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.	Dem dey advertise every day.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.	Na so e still be for all of us today.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment.	And make you stop to dey talk to you before.		0.00	0.00	10.00
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.	We come see sey we fit travel go one place wey dem dey call Bill Tony, for one hall.		0.00	0.00	19.00
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.	Na about 120 people dey happy well well.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.	We come see sey many people dey come from where we dey stay.		0.00	0.00	13.00
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?	This one dey make people happy well well.		0.00	0.00	8.00
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.	For example, some husband and wife dey tell you the good news about you.		0.00	0.00	14.00
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?	But the shoe be sey, dem want make I go preach for synagogue, so that I go fit stay with people wey dey work for this world.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.	E good make we ask ourself sey, ‘ I no dey use all my mind wait for Jehovah. I dey happy well well well when I dey face wahala.		0.00	0.00	29.00
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.	I believe sey na only three-tribe I dey call different different-different people. I believe sey na one of dem dey use take build three-different-different school.                        		0.00	0.00	48.00
The first happy life is the pleasant life.	The first thing dey make life sweet.		0.00	0.00	7.00
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it.	This one dey make your mind come down.		0.00	0.00	8.00
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.	The second thing be sey, the second thing wey you dey do na to show sey you love Jehovah, and you dey sure sey you love am.		0.00	0.00	27.00
That's what Aristotle was talking about.	E get one time wey Aris dey talk about Aristoph.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.	So I want talk sey I no too get any other things wey we fit learn from dem.		0.00	0.00	18.00
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.	The first thing be sey, if we want enjoy life well, we go get am for mind sey we no go too much. And we fit still get am for mind sey we like wetin we dey learn, and wetin we fit do.		0.00	0.00	43.00
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.	But the last one wey dey make dem happy well well well, na im make many people feel sey dem no get sense, and why                                		0.00	0.00	56.00
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.	The first thing be sey, the first thing wey you go do na to show sey you value life well well, and e dey pain am well well.		0.00	0.00	28.00
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.	Na this one make am hard for people to know sey wetin dey make person mind come down, and I dey think about wetin go make people mind come down.		0.00	0.00	30.00
Second is that positive emotion habituates.	The second thing wey we go talk about dey make people happy.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.	The first thing be sey, all of us get one special house wey dem dey call French. The first time wey we go see for one place wey dem dey call French.		0.00	0.00	32.00
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.	And as I dey talk, I no come dey complain.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And this leads to the second life.	And this one dey make our life better.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And I have to tell you about my friend, Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure.	I don tell you why I dey tell people about Jehovah. I dey tell dem why I dey do things with people wey no dey happy.		0.00	0.00	26.00
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful.	The two of dem na Len Len Lenssom, wey be “ Len Len, ” wey dey pioneer for 30 years.		0.00	0.00	20.00
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.	The time wey e dey 20 years, e come dey different.		0.00	0.00	11.00
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company.	The time wey e dey 25 years, e dey 25 years. E dey 25 years that time, e come be head of the head of the head                             		0.00	0.00	55.00
Second, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.	The second thing be sey, dem no dey play wayo.		0.00	0.00	10.00
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.	But the third thing be sey, the third thing wey we go do na to show love.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.	And na wetin happen be that.		0.00	0.00	6.00
American women said to Len, when he dated them, "You're no fun.	E get one women wey im name na Ameren Yarn. E talk sey e no easy for dem.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.	E get one kind money wey dem dey call Psalute Point Point, wey be five years before e reach five years.		0.00	0.00	21.00
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.	But as time dey go, dem come dey sleep with each other.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.	E come dey hungry Len Len of land wey dem dey call Lonton Island. E come dey ben Island wey dem dey call Lonton of Propaganda.		0.00	0.00	26.00
The question is, is Len unhappy?	E good make we ask ourself sey, ‘ I dey                                                       		0.00	0.00	64.00
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.	The tract tell us wetin happen to some of the people wey dey work for there. E tell us sey make we no think sey I dey behave like one of the people wey dey do                            		0.00	0.00	63.00
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.	When you see sey you no dey happy, e dey make you happy well well well.		0.00	0.00	16.00
When the first card is played, until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.	When the first time reach, the first time wey dem dey call Len, water no too dey again.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow.	And na wetin happen be that.		0.00	0.00	6.00
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.	But Micas tell you wetin you go do for your time.		0.00	0.00	11.00
You're one with the music.	Dem dey call one boat wey dem dey call miko.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.	And we no go dey think like that.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are.	We dey think well well sey we dey make mistake because we dey do things like people wey dey do bad.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are.	Many people dey talk bad things about your brothers and sisters.                                                      		0.00	0.00	64.00
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.	And as you dey try, e go make you use your life well.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.	Na your work you dey do, and your work na to show sey you love Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Just one example.	Think am.		0.00	0.00	2.00
She's working her way through college.	Dem come dey work with am.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Her highest strength was social intelligence, so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day.	For example, e get one time wey e go carry shoulder up. E no dey take care of people wey dey work with am.		0.00	0.00	24.00
But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.	But e do everything wey e fit do to make sure sey dem dey do the work.		0.00	0.00	17.00
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.	E dey sweet you well well when you see am.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.	You dey look the Work wey dem dey call Reach.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You don't giggle a lot.	You dey waka pass one thousand years.		0.00	0.00	7.00
So, that's the second path.	Na im make the second thing happen.		0.00	0.00	7.00
The second path is eudaimonian flow.	The second thing wey we go do na to overdo things.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And the third path is meaning.	The third thing wey e mean na something.		0.00	0.00	8.00
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.	Na so e still be for many people today.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.	The truth be sey, e no easy for dem to arrange things like people wey dey do bad things. E no get anything wey you fit do to comot hand from where dem dey.		0.00	0.00	34.00
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question, are there things that lastingly change those lives?	I don talk about three things wey go make life better, and the things wey we get for life wey no go end for life?		0.00	0.00	25.00
And the answer seems to be yes.	And the answer na yes.		0.00	0.00	5.00
It's being done in a rigorous manner.	The truth be sey, e no easy for                                                         		0.00	0.00	64.00
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.	Na so e still be for us today.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So we do random assignment, placebo controlled, long-term studies of different interventions.	So, we dey get different different different place wey we dey call                                                     		0.00	0.00	64.00
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.	The truth be sey, as we dey do good things, we go see how we go take know the kind person wey we get for mind for Jehovah work, how we go take do more work, and how we dey do things.		0.00	0.00	42.00
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.	The second day, you go need to put eye for things wey go make people happy and enjoy life.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.	And we fit show sey we get life wey no go end.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Gratitude visit.	Preaching visit well well.		0.00	0.00	4.00
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked.	No be just to remember person wey no happy for wetin e do.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The person has to be alive.	Person wey dey alive dey alive.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.	Now, you fit open your eye.		0.00	0.00	6.00
I hope all of you have such a person.	I get the hope wey you get.		0.00	0.00	7.00
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door, you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.	The work wey you dey do na to show sey you happy well well well when you dey preach for one place wey dem dey call Point, wey dey call Point, wey dey call Point, wey dey call Phox, or even though sey the place wey dem dey call Point.		0.00	0.00	50.00
And what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.	After three month, we come dey suffer for one week after three month.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Another example is a strength date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths, and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.	Another thing be sey, we dey use all our mind take do good people. We still dey use all their mind and power take different different different people.		0.00	0.00	28.00
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.	But no be only that one make you stop to serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and to contrast it.	The truth be sey, the people wey I preach well well and I dey do everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no do am.		0.00	0.00	28.00
And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set.	And if you see something wey you fit do, you don see something wey you fit do.		0.00	0.00	17.00
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.	When you dey talk to person, e dey hard you to talk to person wey no                                 		0.00	0.00	48.00
So those are examples of positive interventions.	Na im make some people dey talk about Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	9.00
So, the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.	So, the next thing wey I go do to make sure sey I no too get joy again.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And this is really what you're about.	This one really show sey we really get strong mind.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get?	And e good make we ask ourself three things wey dey make life better?		0.00	0.00	14.00
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?	So, e good make we ask ourself this kind question. E good make we ask ourself this kind people sey, ‘ Which time this kind people dey make life better for God eye, enjoyment, enjoyment, and property, enjoyment?		0.00	0.00	38.00
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.	E surprise us sey we come dey feel sey we dey                                       		0.00	0.00	49.00
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.	Many people wey dey serve Jehovah dey enjoy life.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.	This one mean sey na normal thing for life.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.	Na so e still be for people wey dey serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.	If you dey do this kind work, you dey happy sey you no dey do everything wey you fit do to make sure sey you no come.		0.00	0.00	27.00
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.	The truth be sey, the time wey life dey full-time service no be small.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.	For example, if you dey carry body down, e mean sey you no get sense.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?	And wetin dey pain you pass be sey, you no go too dey near Jehovah again?		0.00	0.00	16.00
That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?	Na im make for person to dey put hand for sex matter wey no clean for God eye?		0.00	0.00	18.00
Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life?	Which kind work dey make people happy?		0.00	0.00	7.00
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.	E fit be sey the answer na true.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me.	Na im make Chris talk sey e no easy for me to fit do the work wey e dey do for me.		0.00	0.00	22.00
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things.	Dem no fit talk sey dem no go fit do the work wey dem dey do.		0.00	0.00	16.00
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.	But I come see sey the wahala wey I dey face no be like that. I come see sey the wahala wey I dey wear no be the same.		0.00	0.00	29.00
We all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes.	We know sey all this things don make us no too dey put mind for things wey concern God, and the things wey we want do.		0.00	0.00	26.00
We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery.	We still know sey many things wey we fit do to make sure sey we no dey too worry too much.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important.	The truth be sey, the way we take dey work na to show sey we really dey happy.		0.00	0.00	18.00
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.	E get one time wey I come dey think sey, if I go, I no think sey I no go fit make person vex.		0.00	0.00	24.00
And I never found that.	And I no ever see that kind thing.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery.	The truth be sey, when we dey train ourself well, e go make sense to dey teach people the truth wey dey Bible. The truth be sey, when we dey do things wey go make people happy, e dey sweet us well well.		0.00	0.00	43.00
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.	The truth be sey, the money wey I take dey make people no too believe wetin I dey talk, and I believe am                         		0.00	0.00	47.00
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion, and that's typically how they've been used.	The truth be sey, we fit even get three things wey we fit do to make sure sey we really happy, and e dey make our mind come down.		0.00	0.00	29.00
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough -- there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.	But as time dey go, I dey happy well well well. I dey make my mind come down, no be only the same thing for life.		0.00	0.00	26.00
As Laura Lee told us, design, and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.	For example, Laura tell us sey make we wear better cloth, cloth, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, music, and property.		0.00	0.00	25.00
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet.	Na so e still be for some of the things wey dem dey do for the convention. So, when we dey do things wey go make people happy, e dey make me happy, e dey make me happy.		0.00	0.00	38.00
And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.	E fit still be sey the next time wey we spend that kind life, we go get am for mind, and we go need to get better life.		0.00	0.00	28.00
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.	If we dey put mind for the better things wey we dey watch, e go help us make we no too much.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaimonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.	If we get this one for mind, e go help us get better mind, and we go get better sense.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point.	E fit be sey the man no value wetin e dey do for the matter.		0.00	0.00	15.00
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.	Dem use one of dem wey be “ London London London.		0.00	0.00	11.00
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West.	E get one time wey we go stay for West West.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So what's really going on?	So make you quick go preach?		0.00	0.00	6.00
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free, they said in Renaissance Germany.	E just be like sey dem no know the truth wey dey Bible and Rench language.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.	Dem no really want make people fight war.		0.00	0.00	8.00
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.	E fit be say people no get power to preach.                                       		0.00	0.00	48.00
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.	E just be like sey dem build the motor well well, and dem                                    		0.00	0.00	48.00
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.	Dem dey waka for house, and dem dey waka pass before.		0.00	0.00	11.00
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.	One of the sixth World War I for Brother W.		0.00	0.00	10.00
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.	Dem dey always remember sey government dey allow government direct dem.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.	For example, e get one city wey Jehovah arrange.		0.00	0.00	9.00
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?	E no easy for dem to do this work?		0.00	0.00	9.00

One-sixth of humanity is there.	One sixth na one of the sixth.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And here's the second punch line.	The second thing be sey, the second thing wey we do dey happen.		0.00	0.00	13.00
That's the news from downtown.	No be so e be.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.	Many years don pass before.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Now we're shining right back up.	Now, we dey get chance to preach.		0.00	0.00	7.00
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years, and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.	E don tey wey we come from the three years wey we dey stay for this earth.		0.00	0.00	17.00
This is an example of a real meteorite, and you can see all the melting of the iron from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth, and just how much of it survives and melts.	For example, e get one time wey you go see sey e dey hard you to see the kind cloth wey dey inside, and how e go take happen, and how e go take happen.		0.00	0.00	35.00
From a meteorite from space, we’re over here with an original Sputnik.	E get one time wey one sister wey im name na Sputer comot from Sputer.		0.00	0.00	15.00
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.	This one na one of the first person wey get sense and wey no fit see.		0.00	0.00	16.00
The space age began 50 years ago in October, and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.	E don reach 50 years wey October, October, and Shair wey dem dey call Sattk.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And it wouldn’t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a flag that was carried to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.	E no too tey, e no fit talk sey e no get belle. E just be like sey e no fit die for Amoog.		0.00	0.00	24.00
The astronauts each got to carry about ten silk flags in their personal kits.	But as dem dey go, dem come dey carry body down.		0.00	0.00	11.00
They would bring them back and mount them.	Dem go come back to the mountain and the mountain.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So this has actually been carried to the moon and back.	Na im make e no tey, na so e still be for the                            		0.00	0.00	40.00
The dawn of books is, of course, important.	The truth be sey, we dey teach people the truth.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.	And e no sweet us to know how to prepare our book dem for Bible.		0.00	0.00	15.00
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg in 1455.	You go see how the verse and the way you dey talk fit make your mind come down.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology, is not the book.	But no be only the way dem take arrange Bible, dem come see sey no be only                        		0.00	0.00	40.00
You see, the book was not driven by reading.	You see the book of the book wey dem dey call                               		0.00	0.00	41.00
So why did the printing press succeed?	So, why e good make we use sense take do the work?                            		0.00	0.00	39.00
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.	Na this one make our mind come down.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man, 550 years ago.	Na im make for 550 years before Jesus start to print the first book wey dem print for one story.		0.00	0.00	20.00
We are living at the age here at the end of the book, where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.	For example, when we dey young, we no need to know where we suppose do reach.		0.00	0.00	16.00
But why is this so interesting?	But why e be like that?		0.00	0.00	6.00
It turns out that in the 1450s, the Catholic Church needed money, and so they actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences, which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.	Na im make for the 1400,000 people wey dey rule that time, dem need money, so that dem go need money and property.		0.00	0.00	23.00
They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.	Dem dey travel go different different place for Europe and many years.		0.00	0.00	12.00
They got you out of purgatory faster.	Dem do wetin you want.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences, which was the equivalent of printing money.	When dem print the printing machine wey dem dey call pretend, dem fit see wetin dem need.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 -- to print out thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of single, small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.	Na im make all of us start to dey print the book wey dem dey call Western Europe. Many times, e pass 1455 years wey dem print, and now wey dem dey call Awake!		0.00	0.00	34.00
So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen, was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading.	So, the printing machine wey dey give talk to person wey need help. Na this one make the printing machine no be small.		0.00	0.00	23.00
More tomorrow.	More.		0.00	0.00	1.00
We’re going to have some tomorrow.	E dey hungry some of dem to stay.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?	For where! We dey go, we dey look for where we dey stay?		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.	So, I come marry one woman.		0.00	0.00	6.00
You’re going to find out why in a minute, because when I went to see Eileen, this is what I said I wanted to build.	E get one time wey I go preach for area wey dem dey call Eminute, because I want see wetin I want do.		0.00	0.00	23.00
This is the Library of Human Imagination.	E dey pain us well well.		0.00	0.00	6.00
The room itself is three stories tall.	The room dey cause three things for inside.                                 		0.00	0.00	40.00
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination that are computer controlled.	For the 5,000 years wey dem dey call professor, dem dey feel sey e no easy for person to control imself.		0.00	0.00	21.00
The room is a theatre.	The room wey dem dey call Awake!		0.00	0.00	7.00
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.	And all of us dey use all our mind support the preaching work.		0.00	0.00	13.00
It’s designed like an Escher print.	Na so e be like that.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Here is some of the lower level of the library, where the exhibits constantly change.	E fit be sey the person wey dey look the motor well well for where e dey stay.		0.00	0.00	18.00
You can walk through.	If you dey waka, you go fit waka well.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.	You fit see am sey e get many things wey dem fit do for this kind room.		0.00	0.00	17.00
There’s my very own Saturn V.	After, I come marry MarV.		0.00	0.00	5.00
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.	For example, e get one time wey many people think sey dem no go fit count the story.		0.00	0.00	18.00
There is a glass bridge that you walk across that’s suspended in space.	E get one time wey you go carry body up. E fit be sey you dey waka up.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So it’s a leap of imagination.	So make we no think like that.		0.00	0.00	7.00
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show one or two more objects from the stage, but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it.	So, I dey use all my mind and power take support the preaching work. But now, I dey show sey I really like the people wey dey use all their mind serve Jehovah.		0.00	0.00	33.00
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home and share it with the TED community.	E sweet me well well and I happy as I dey go one place wey dem dey call TD TD.		0.00	0.00	20.00
It’s all about seeing things that everybody else has seen before but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.	The truth be sey, all of us don see sey we don dey think about how many people dey think.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.	And when we dey think well well, e go make our mind come down.                          		0.00	0.00	39.00
For example, we can look at a DNA molecule model here.	For example, we fit see one place wey dem dey call Nabbach.		0.00	0.00	12.00
None of us really have ever seen one, but we know it exists because we’ve been taught to understand this molecule.	E get one time wey we don dey serve Jehovah well, but we know sey e no easy for us to understand.		0.00	0.00	22.00
But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine.	But we fit still see one machine wey dem dey call World War II.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?	Now, you fit talk sey this one na true?		0.00	0.00	9.00
Well, this is the code for life, and this is a code for death.	Na this one be the main thing for life and death.		0.00	0.00	11.00
These two molecules code and decode.	This two of dem dey treat each other well.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.	And if you see dem, you go see dem as                                        		0.00	0.00	49.00
But once you’ve seen them in a new way, you realize that both of these things really are connected.	But now, you don see dem sey this things don make dem happy.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.	And na wetin happen to one sister be that.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You see, this is a human brain model, OK?	You dey see this one?		0.00	0.00	5.00
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.	We no dey happy because we no know where we suppose do reach.		0.00	0.00	13.00
We get to see a skull.	We dey see one place wey we dey see.		0.00	0.00	9.00
All of imagination -- everything that we think, we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.	For example, we go think well well about everything wey we fit do to make sure sey we no fall.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And once we create new patterns in this brain, once we shape the brain in a new way, it never returns to its original shape.	Na so e still be for us today. If we want make the rain fall for this world, e go hard us to put eye for the rain wey dey inside.		0.00	0.00	31.00
And I’ll give you a quick example.	And I still dey quick vex.		0.00	0.00	6.00
We think about the Internet; we think about information that goes across the Internet.	We dey think about the Internet ; we dey think about the things wey we dey read for Internet.                           		0.00	0.00	45.00
And we never think about the hidden connection.	We no ever think about how the matter take happen.		0.00	0.00	10.00
But I brought along here a lump of coal -- right here, one lump of coal.	But as I dey go, I come see one place wey dem dey call co                                  		0.00	0.00	48.00
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?	And wetin go happen to Internal?		0.00	0.00	6.00
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net.	You dey see am as person wey get power to fit buy something.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So every time you download a file, each megabyte is a lump of coal.	So as time dey go, you dey waka pass one place wey dem dey call                                   		0.00	0.00	49.00
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file looks like this, ladies and gentlemen.	This one mean sey na 200 cle wey dem dey call Tabgle, and e dey                              		0.00	0.00	44.00
So the next time you download a gigabyte, or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?	So, the next time wey you take dey forado, two of dem no get right to stay.		0.00	0.00	17.00
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible, possible.	E dey hungry us to run from where we dey stay, and we fit think well well.		0.00	0.00	17.00
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.

And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior.	When I dey think about wetin happen to Karen, I no believe sey na fake religion I dey talk about.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.	E fit be sey we still dey fear to tell people about wetin we go do.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.	Sometimes, we fit dey think sey we no go believe.		0.00	0.00	10.00
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world."	If you know where you suppose do reach, e mean sey you must change the world.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior.	(Rom. 5: 14) And we don already believe sey people wey dey serve God no suppose believe sey na only theirself we dey talk about.		0.00	0.00	25.00
