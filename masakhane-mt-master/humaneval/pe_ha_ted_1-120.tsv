His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters.	Magabtansa sun sa fuskarsa, kamar waɗanda ka gani a nan gaba ko uku.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time.	Saboda haka, babu shakka, mai wa’azi a ƙasashen waje kamar Leonardo ya kafa halaye na kai a kai.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So let's try to find them.	Sai wata ƙungiya ta kãma su.		0.00	0.00	6.00
I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.	Na yi tunanin cewa idan za mu iya yin aiki kuma mu nemi halaye masu kyau, za mu ga fuskarsa a gare mu.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.	Saboda haka, na duba dukan abubuwan da ya jawo, fiye da 700, kuma na nemi wasu halaye masu kyau.		0.00	0.00	19.00
There are about 120, you see them here.	Da akwai kusan 120, ka gan su a nan.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?	Waɗanne irin waɗannan halaye ne za su iya zama halayen kansu?		0.00	0.00	11.00
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.	Saboda haka, domin za a yi su kamar yadda muka gani, sai ka fusata ko uku.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So we can eliminate all the profiles.	Saboda haka, za mu iya kawar da dukan abubuwa.		0.00	0.00	9.00
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.	Ƙari ga haka, yana da isashen abin da ya                                                   		0.00	0.00	59.00
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.	Saboda haka, za mu iya kawar da waɗanda ba su da laifi ko kuma baƙin ciki.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.	Kuma mun san cewa Leonardo mutum ne mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	9.00
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.	Saboda haka, za mu iya kawar da waɗanda suke kula da su ko kuma masu aiki.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Yes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.	Hakika, tsohon mutum yana wurin, kamar yadda wannan mutumin ya jawo Homo Vitruvius.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."	Kuma bãbu abin da ya kasance jawãbin mutãne fãce ɗai suka ce:" Mai rahama ne."		0.00	0.00	15.00
Before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.	Kafin mu shiga waɗannan fuskoki, ya kamata in bayyana dalilin da ya sa zan iya yin magana game da su.		0.00	0.00	20.00
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.	Na yi shekaru 1,100 na sababbin mutane, fiye da shekara 300, baƙin ciki, shekaru 30 kawai.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.	Saboda haka, na san kaɗan game da matsa da kuma baƙin ciki.		0.00	0.00	12.00
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.	Ka duba waɗannan halaye uku.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw that.	Na yi imani da idanuna sa’ad da na ga hakan.		0.00	0.00	10.00
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.	Babu dalilin da ya sa waɗannan halayen ya kamata su mai da hankali.		0.00	0.00	13.00
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar.	Dukanmu mun biɗi halaye masu kyau da suke da halaye masu kyau, kuma mu duba su.		0.00	0.00	16.00

Yes, it does.	Hakika.		0.00	0.00	1.00
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time.	Saboda haka, muna da hotuna uku, wanda shi ne Leonardo a lokacin.		0.00	0.00	12.00
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?	To, yãya muke sanin sa, kuma bã mu da wani mataimaki?		0.00	0.00	11.00
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.	Kuma sifar Leonardo kawai ce aka amince da ita.		0.00	0.00	9.00

And if we now compare the face of the statue, with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.	Kuma idan muka gwada fuskar mawaƙa, da fuskar maciji, za ka ga irin waɗannan fasalolin.		0.00	0.00	15.00

In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms led me to a new form, which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.	A cikin kõgon, sai na yi bincike a kan wasu wurare kuma na ƙaura zuwa wani sansani da ke kusa da birnin Durdan Dur                             		0.00	0.00	52.00
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community at that point, and started developing, really, and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.	Ƙari ga haka, na sami zarafin soma aiki tare da wannan yankin, kuma na soma tasowa, da gaske, kuma ina tuntuɓe su a cikin kalamai, a fannoni na                    		0.00	0.00	47.00
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.	Kuma ba da daɗewa ba aka yi girma daga masu raunana biyar a cikin shekara ɗaya.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.

Now what are some of the results?	To, menene sakamakon?		0.00	0.00	3.00
Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much, and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.

Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents.	Wataƙila abin da ya fi muhimmanci da muke gani shi ne iyaye.		0.00	0.00	12.00
They own the laptops.	Waɗancan tãtsũniyõyinsu ne.		0.00	0.00	3.00
And so when I met with three children from the schools, who had traveled all day to come to Bogota, one of the three children brought her mother.

And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write.	Kuma dalilin da ya sa ta haifi mamarta ita ce wannan yarinya’ yar shekara shida tana koya wa mamarta yadda za ta karanta da kuma rubuta.		0.00	0.00	26.00

So now, in closing, people say, now why laptops?	Saboda haka, a yanzu, mutane suna cewa, yanzu me ya sa mutane suke shan wahala?		0.00	0.00	15.00
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods.	Laptops abu ne mai ban sha’awa ; kamar yadda yake ba su abinci.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The reason you want laptops is that the word is education, not laptop.	Dalilin da ya sa kake son saƙonmu shi ne cewa kalmar ilimi ce, ba fasa ba.		0.00	0.00	16.00
This is an education project, not a laptop project.	Wannan makarantu ne, ba tsarin koyarwa ba.		0.00	0.00	7.00

In a village, you have 100 laptops, each with a different set of 100 books, and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.	A cikin ƙauyen, kana da littattafai 100, kowanne cikin littattafai 100, kuma wannan ƙauyen yana da littattafai 10,000.		0.00	0.00	18.00

Sometimes school is under a tree, or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education, so you need a collaborative model of learning, not just building more schools and training more teachers, which you have to do anyway.

And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well.

Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.	Yanzu, ba dukan runduna ba ne.		0.00	0.00	6.00
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions involving kindness, care and empathy are an essential part of the job.	Amma waɗanda suke tunani cewa irin waɗannan halayen mutane sun ƙunshi alheri, kula da juyayi suna da muhimmanci a aikin.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.	Kuma kwatankwacinsu ba ya ɗauke da maganar wasu halittu.		0.00	0.00	9.00
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.	Waɗannan rundunar suna da ɗabi’a mai kyau da wasu mutane suke yi.		0.00	0.00	12.00

Practical wisdom, Aristotle told us, "is the combination of moral will and moral skill."	Hikima cikakka! Sai Aristos ya gaya mana cewa," Zuriya ce da ta biye."		0.00	0.00	13.00
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule, as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.

To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.	Don su bauta wa wasu, kada su tilasta wa wasu mutane.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And finally, perhaps most important, a wise person is made, not born.	Daga baya, wataƙila ya fi muhimmanci, mutum mai hikima bai haifi mutum ba.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Wisdom depends on experience, and not just any experience.	Hikima ta dangana ne a kan abin da ya faru, kuma babu abin da ya faru.		0.00	0.00	16.00
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.	Kana bukatar lokaci don ka san mutanen da suke hidima.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You need permission to be allowed to improvise, try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.	Ya kamata ka ƙyale a ƙyale ka gyara sababbin abubuwa, a wasu lokatai ka kasa kuma ka koya daga kasawarka.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.	Ƙari ga haka, malamai masu hikima suna bukatar su ƙarfafa ka.		0.00	0.00	11.00
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described how hard it is to learn to do their job, they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

If you have one reason for doing something and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing, it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you're more likely to do it.

But you don't feel them, because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak, so they just fly through you.	Amma ba ka ji su ba, domin waɗanda suka raunana suna da lahani da kuma raunanan da suka raunana, saboda haka, ba su da ƙarfi.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And these particles have been discovered over the last century, pretty much.	Kuma an gano waɗannan talifofin fiye da ƙarni na ƙarshe, sun fi yawa.		0.00	0.00	13.00
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897, and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino, in the year 2000.	A shekara ta 1897, an gano wannan abin da aka kira haraji na farko a shekara ta 2000.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.	A lokacin da sararin samaniya yake, hanyar da ta dace.		0.00	0.00	10.00
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find, is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.	Ɗaya daga cikin abubuwa masu ban al’ajabi, na iske shi ne na gane wasu daga cikinsu, sa’ad da ka fahimci yadda suke.		0.00	0.00	22.00
You know, they're a step in size from the entire observable universe.	Ka sani, ka ɗauki mataki da yawa daga dukan sararin samaniya.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So, 100 billion galaxies, 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey, actually, is about the same as from Monterey to these things.

Absolutely, exquisitely minute, and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.	Babu shakka, yin hidima da kyau, kuma duk da haka, ba a gano cewa an cika shi sosai.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So, one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford, discoverer of the atomic nucleus, once said, "All science is either physics or stamp collecting."	Sai ɗaya daga cikina ya yi dũbi zuwa ga Manchter, Ernd Rutherford, mai yãwo, mai yiwuwa ya ce:" Kasancewa bã ta da wata sanyi."		0.00	0.00	24.00
Now, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.	Yanzu, ba na ganin yana nufin cewa yana nufin ya hana wasu kimiyya, ko da yake shi daga Sabon Zealand ne, hakan ya yiwu.		0.00	0.00	24.00
OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is -- really you've done stamp collecting.	To, idan ba ku fahimci dalilin da ya sa ya kamata ku san dalilin da ya sa ya kamata ku yi hakan.		0.00	0.00	22.00
Fortunately, we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern.	Abin baƙin ciki, wataƙila muna ɗaya daga cikin abubuwa mafi girma na kimiyya da suka faru a ƙarni na farko da suka nuna wannan halin.		0.00	0.00	25.00
It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics.	Ita ce fansar wuyan rassa, idan kun kasance mãsu aikatãwa.		0.00	0.00	10.00
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.	Tabbacin da ake kira mizani da kyau na musamman.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt, which is always the sign of elegance.	Za ka iya manne shi a gaban itacen da ke gabashin Kan’ana, wadda koyaushe alama ce ta zama alama.		0.00	0.00	19.00
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.	Amma, wannan shirin yana sa ka ƙera dukan abubuwan da ke faruwa a sararin samaniya.		0.00	0.00	15.00
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle, you've got a big enough computer -- why DNA is the shape it is.

In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.	A ƙa’ida, ya kamata ka iya ƙin wannan tsarin.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Can anyone see what it is?	To, shin, akwai mai gan shi?		0.00	0.00	6.00

I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.	Za ta sa ta kasance da sauƙi, ta wurin zuba ɗaya daga cikin itatuwa.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Basically, each of these terms refers to some of the particles.	A wani lokaci, kowanne cikin waɗannan kalaman yana nufin wasu cikin talifofin.		0.00	0.00	12.00
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.	Sai waɗannan da ke wurin suka yi nuni ga Walƙalan, da kuma yadda suka zauna tare.		0.00	0.00	16.00
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.	Waɗannan masu kula da masu raunanan da suka raunana, Zs, ɗaya                                                 		0.00	0.00	59.00
Higgs particles have not been discovered.	Ba a taɓa ganinsu ba.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.	Saboda haka, dukan al’adu da yawa da za mu iya yi da wannan tsarin ba zai yiwu ba.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.	To, muna da lokaci da za mu tashi da baiwa mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government, Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said, "If you guys can explain, in language a politician can understand, what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.	Ƙari ga haka, a shekara ta 198000000008, sa’ad da muke son kuɗi daga ƙasar Amirka, Margaret Thater, ya ce: “ Idan kana iya bayyana abin da za ka iya faɗa a yaren siyasa, za ka fahimci abin da Jahannama take yi.		0.00	0.00	41.00
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."	Lalle ne nĩ, inã nufin in san abin da ake ce wa Hãrũna."		0.00	0.00	13.00
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.	Kuma mun haɗu da wannan gaggawa, kuma hakan ya nuna cewa muna aiki.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.	To, abin da Higiya ya yi ke nan, yana ba da rauni ga rukuni na musamman.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.	Kuma hoton shi ne cewa dukan sararin samaniya, kuma wannan matashi yana nufin cewa ni ne, kuma a cikinku duka sararin samaniya yana cike da wani abu da ake kira Higgggggg                     		0.00	0.00	51.00
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.	Abin baƙin ciki shi ne cewa waɗannan mutanen a cikin ɗakin Majami’ar Mulki ne.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Now when a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles.	Yanzu, idan wani sashe ya motsa sararin samaniya, zai iya yin amfani da waɗannan talifofin Higys.		0.00	0.00	16.00
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.	Amma ka yi tunanin wani da ba ya son kai a ɗakin.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Then everyone ignores them.	Sa'an nan kuma ya jũya bãya.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room.	Kuma ka yi tunanin wani yana da muhimmanci sosai kuma yana tafiya cikin ɗakin.		0.00	0.00	14.00
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.	Mutanen da suka kewaye su sun kewaye su, kuma sun shiga ɗakin.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It's almost like they get heavy.	Kamar dai sũ, jãkuna firgitattu ne.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.	Kuma hanyar ¦ ãgũtu tã tabbata a gare su.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy, in a sense, and massive, because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.	Wannan kwatancin shi ne cewa abubuwan da ke cikin jikinka da kuma sararin samaniya da muke gani a kewaye da mu suna da nauyi, da kuma ƙyama, domin sun kewaye su da Higiya.		0.00	0.00	33.00

If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.	Idan haka ne, muna bukatar mu fahimci waɗannan’ yan Higgs da ke LHC.		0.00	0.00	13.00
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC.	Idan ba gaskiya ba ne domin rashin son kai, ko da yake abin da ya fi muhimmanci shi ne yin tunani sosai game da aikin Higiya, duk da haka, mun sani cewa mun juya a gidan LC.		0.00	0.00	37.00
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.	Saboda haka, ɗaya daga cikin dalilan da suka sa muka gina wannan jaridar.		0.00	0.00	13.00
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.	Na gane cewa Margaret Thacher ne.		0.00	0.00	6.00
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.	Babu shakka, abin da Littafi Mai Tsarki ya ce za a samu.		0.00	0.00	12.00
There are many other things.	Da akwai wasu abubuwa da yawa.		0.00	0.00	6.00
There's another issue, which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually -- seem, as you go back in time, they seem to change in strength.	Wani batu kuma shi ne cewa rundunar da suke da kyakkyawan hali, kamar yadda ka dawo a lokacin, suna canjawa.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Well, they do change in strength.	To, suna canjawa cikin ƙarfi.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together, gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.	Saboda haka, tilasta da ke ɗauke da mu, tilas da ke ɗauke da mu, yana da ƙarfi yayin da ka je ka girma.		0.00	0.00	23.00
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker.	Ƙarfafa mai ƙarfi, iko mai ƙarfi, wanda yake da tsabta tare, yana raunana.		0.00	0.00	13.00
It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.	Abin da ya fi muhimmanci shi ne, kamar dai akwai wani abu mai kyau da ya fi muhimmanci, a farkon lokaci.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.	Yanzu, jawabin da aka kira shi a matsayin alama, wadda ta nanata adadin kashi biyu a cikin mizanai na farko, wanda a gaban idanu, ba ta da sauƙi.		0.00	0.00	28.00
But actually, with this theory, we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy.	Amma, da wannan jigon, mun ga cewa rundunar halitta suna da ban sha’awa tare, a lokacin Big-Ug-Ug-Gabas.		0.00	0.00	17.00
Also, those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter.	Ƙari ga haka, waɗannan talifofi na alama suna da ƙarfi sosai domin batun.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics.	Saboda haka, jawabi mai daɗi da ake yi a zahiri.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC.	Kuma idan ina son in saka kuɗi a kan kuɗi, zan saka kuɗi a hanyar da ba ta kimiyya ba, cewa waɗannan abubuwa za su tashi a LHC.		0.00	0.00	28.00
Many other things that the LHC could discover.	Wasu abubuwa da yawa da LHC zai iya fahimtar su.		0.00	0.00	10.00
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.

And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story, if you'd like -- about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.	Kuma na yi tunanin yadda na yi tunani a kan abin da ya ba mu labarin halitta mai ban al’ajabi, idan ba haka ba, daga kimiyya ta zamani fiye                                            		0.00	0.00	72.00
And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.	Kuma Ild ya ce ya cancanci a cikin ruhun Dauda. ”		0.00	0.00	11.00
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.	Wannan labarin halitta ne, ina tunani, kamar yadda nake ji.		0.00	0.00	10.00

The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation.	A lokacin, sararin samaniya ya yi fahariya da ake kira.		0.00	0.00	10.00
In about the first billionth of a second or so, the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass.	A cikin biliyan na farko na biyu ko kuma na biyu, Higgs ya yi gunaguni, da kuma ƙwayoyin da ke sa mu yi nasara.		0.00	0.00	24.00
The universe continued to expand and cool.	sararin samaniya ya ci gaba da faɗawa da kuma sanyi.		0.00	0.00	10.00
After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe.	Bayan’ yan mintoci, da akwai munafunci a sararin samaniya.                                                             		0.00	0.00	69.00
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium.	Sararin samaniya yana kusan shekara 75, kilomita 25.		0.00	0.00	8.00
It continued to expand about 300 million years.	Ya ci gaba da faɗaɗa kusan shekara 300.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Then light began to travel through the universe.	Sai haske ya soma tafiya a sararin samaniya.		0.00	0.00	8.00
It was big enough to be transparent to light, and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God.	Abin da muka gani a wuraren da George Smot ya nuna cewa yana kallon fuskar Allah.		0.00	0.00	16.00
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed, and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook into the heavier elements.	Bayan shekara arba’in, taurari na farko da aka kafa, kuma wannan munafunci, bayan haka, sai suka soma kallon tsofaffi.		0.00	0.00	19.00
So the elements of life -- carbon, and oxygen and iron, all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars, which then ran out of fuel, exploded, threw those elements back into the universe.

And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen to form water, liquid water on the surface.

On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world.

As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said, these are the things -- and actually, not only these, but I was looking around -- these are the things, like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik, and DNA, and literature and science -- these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years.

If the weak force had been a little bit different, then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable inside the hearts of stars, and there would be none of that in the universe.

It makes me really feel that that civilization -- which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics, and a few hydrogen atoms -- then I think, to me anyway, it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there, and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess.

We gotta kill them because they're making a mess.	Kuma Muka kashe su, sabõda haka suka wãyi gari sunã guggurfãne.		0.00	0.00	11.00

And he said that was impossible.	Kuma ya ce ba zai yiwu ba.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And I'm sure I'm in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it's impossible.	Kuma na tabbata cewa Ilm yana tare da wani abu mai kyau da ya samu, sa’ad da wani ya gaya maka cewa ba                          		0.00	0.00	48.00

But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.	Amma a cikin dalilin da ya sa na samu wannan sha’awar ita ce na soma lura cewa mun san dukan abubuwan da za su faru a kan jirgin’ yan Adam, kuma babu wanda zai iya mai da hankali ga dukan abubuwan da suke rayuwa.		0.00	0.00	44.00
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.

And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.	Kuma sa’ad da na soma kallon su, na ga cewa suna da munafunci.		0.00	0.00	13.00
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.	Sun yi farin ciki sosai a rayuwa tare da mu.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.	Ƙari ga haka, mun yi ƙoƙari mu kashe su a kowane lokaci.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.	Kuma a yin haka, muna warkar da su domin suna bauta wa Jehobah.		0.00	0.00	13.00
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.	Muna ba su dukan dalilai da za su sa su canja sababbin hanyoyi.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.	Alal misali, furucin nan suna ƙaruwa sosai.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.	Kuma wanda ya yi nufin wani abu daga gare su, to, lalle ne yã yi sakaci ga abin da yake yin rõwa, kuma ya yi rõwa.		0.00	0.00	26.00
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.	Saboda haka, na yi tunani, wasiƙar ta gina wani abu mai amfani.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.	Saboda haka, wasiƙar ta ba da wani abu da za mu iya amfani da shi, kuma mu sami wata hanya da za mu yi sabon dangantaka da waɗannan batutuwa.		0.00	0.00	29.00
And so I built the vending machine.	Kuma na gina tsarin gunduma.		0.00	0.00	5.00
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.	Amma labarin wannan taron ya fi daɗi idan ka sani game da littattafai.		0.00	0.00	13.00
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.	Hakan ya nuna cewa ba za a tsira da dabbobin’ yan Adam ba.		0.00	0.00	13.00
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.	Theysere ta samu ko’ina a ko’ina, sai dai domin Armageddon da kuma kudancin Amirka.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.	Kuma a dukan waɗannan wuraren, ba a ganinsu ba ne kawai, waɗanda suka fito daga dabbobi biyar.		0.00	0.00	17.00
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.	Saboda haka, ba za mu iya yin tunani game da su ba, amma a duk lokacin da suka kewaye su.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.	Kuma ba abin mamaki ba ne, ya ba’ yan Adam haihuwa, fiye da rabi na’ yan Adam yana zama a birane yanzu.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.	Ƙari ga haka, mutane tara da suke girma suna faruwa a birane.		0.00	0.00	12.00
We're seeing a population boom with crows.	Za a ga wani jirgin ruwa da ke cike da littattafai.		0.00	0.00	11.00
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.	Saboda haka, tsuntsaye suna nuna cewa za mu iya ganin yadda za mu yi girma a cikin ƙuruciyarsu.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.	Amma abin da ya fi muhimmanci a gare ni shi ne in san cewa tsuntsaye suna da tsuntsaye a hanya mai                         		0.00	0.00	45.00
And I'll give you an example of that.	Kuma ka buga maka misãlai.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So this is Betty.	Wancan!		0.00	0.00	1.00
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.	Kuma waɗannan jama’a suna amfani da littattafai a cikin jama’a don su sami kwanciyar hankali da kuma abin da ba shi daga itace.		0.00	0.00	23.00
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.	A nan, ƙoƙarin yin amfani da ruwan inabi.		0.00	0.00	8.00
But the researchers had a problem.	Amma masu bincike suna da matsala.		0.00	0.00	6.00
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.	Sai suka tafi sunã shãwara a ɓõye(sunã cẽwa).		0.00	0.00	8.00
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.	Kuma ba ta da zarafin yin hakan a dā.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You see, it wasn't working very well.	Ka ga cewa ba ka yin aiki sosai.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Now this is completely unprompted.	Yanzu wannan ba daidai ba ne.		0.00	0.00	6.00
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.	Babu wanda ya koya mata ta shiga cikin wani bege, ya nuna mata yadda za ta iya faruwa.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But she did it all on her own.	Amma ta yi iya ƙoƙarinta.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.	Saboda haka, ka tuna cewa ba a taɓa ganin wannan ba.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.	(Zabura 119: 163) Tarbiyyarsu ta zama ruwan dare ɗaya, kamar yadda ruwan inabi yake.		0.00	0.00	14.00
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.	Da akwai abubuwa dabam-dabam da suke da shi.		0.00	0.00	8.00
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.	Alal misali, a Sweden, gidaje za su jira mutane masu tseren jirgin ruwa a cikin jirgin ruwa.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.	To, a lõkacin da masĩfa suka tafi, sai suka wãyi gari sunã guggurfãne, kuma su ci daga gare shi, kuma su ci daga gare shi, kõ kuwa su ci daga gare shi.		0.00	0.00	32.00
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.	Lalle ne, mãsu taƙawã nã da wani wurin sãmun babban rabo.		0.00	0.00	11.00
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.	A wani farmaki dabam, a Jami’ar Washington, sun yi shekaru kaɗan da suka shige, suna yin wani abu na dindindin da suka tsira a kan gungume.		0.00	0.00	26.00
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.	Wasu ɗalibai sun fita kuma suka sadu da wasu littattafai, suka kawo su, suka yi nauyi, kuma suka ƙafa su da abin da ba su sani ba, sai su sake juya su.		0.00	0.00	32.00
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.	Ƙari ga haka, sun fahimci cewa don sauran mako, waɗannan littattafan, duk lokacin da waɗannan ɗaliban suka yi tafiya a kan sansanin, waɗannan littattafan za su girbe su, kuma su yi tseren rayuwarsu.		0.00	0.00	33.00
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.	Sun yi nishaɗi sosai sa’ad da wannan ya je mako na gaba.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And the next month.	Da watanni.		0.00	0.00	2.00
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.	Har sai suka sauke karatu kuma suka bar sansanin sansani, kuma suka yi farin ciki don su tafi, sai Idin ya dawo daga baya, kuma suka iske su.		0.00	0.00	28.00
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.	Saboda haka, kasancewa da ɗabi’ar ɗabi’a, ba ta da gudummawa.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.	Saboda haka, yanzu, ɗalibai a Jami’ar Washington da suke nazarin waɗannan littattafai suna yin haka da jarirai da kuma kayayyaki.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.	Saboda haka, mun san cewa waɗannan littattafan suna da ban mamaki ba, amma na fahimci cewa sun fi muhimmanci sosai.		0.00	0.00	20.00
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.	Yanzu matsalar tana ɗauke da bashin, ba tare da ɓata lokaci ba.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.	Ka yi shiri don hasken ya hana matsalar.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.	Sa'an nan ka sanya barcinku hũtãwa?		0.00	0.00	6.00
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.	Saboda haka, abin da yake da muhimmanci game da wannan batu da ake amfani da su wajen yin barci.		0.00	0.00	19.00
In fact, that's old hat for crows.	Ã'a, azzalumai sunã cikin rufi.		0.00	0.00	5.00
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.	Hakan ya faru kusan shekara 10 da suka shige a wani wuri da ake kira Senje City, a makarantar da ke kusa da garin Tokyo.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.	Kuma tun daga lokacin, dukan jama’a a cikin maƙwabta suna wakiltar wannan halin.                               		0.00	0.00	43.00
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.	Kuma yanzu, kowane mutum yana tsaye a cikin kilomita biyar yana tsaye ta wurin tafiya, yana jiran jirgin ruwa.		0.00	0.00	19.00
So, they're learning from each other.	Saboda haka, suna koyo daga juna.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Parents seem to be teaching their young.	Kamar dai iyaye suna koyar da yaransu.		0.00	0.00	7.00
They've learned from their peers.	Sun koya daga tsaransu.		0.00	0.00	4.00
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.	Idan ina da ɗan lokaci, sai na gaya maka game da wani batu mai ban mamaki da ya kwatanta hakan.		0.00	0.00	20.00
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.	Dalilin da ya sa aka kafa al’ada na al’ada.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.	Kuma kamar yadda muka ji a farkon lõkaci, sai jirãgen dabbõbin ni'ima ta kãmã su, kuma suka yi rantsuwa da ita.		0.00	0.00	21.00
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.	Za su iya yin hakan nan da nan kuma su yi ƙoƙari su saba da ƙalubale da kuma sababbin abubuwa a yankinsu, wannan yana da amfani idan kana zama a birnin.		0.00	0.00	31.00
So we know that there's lots of crows.	Sai muka sani cẽwa lalle shi, wãjibi ne.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.	Mun gano cewa za su iya koyar da juna.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.	Ƙari ga haka, sa’ad da hakan ya bayyana mini, na fahimci abin da ya fi muhimmanci na yi shi ne gina babban taro.		0.00	0.00	23.00
This is a vending machine for crows.	Lalle ne, wannan, haƙĩƙa, littãfi ne mai daraja.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.	Kuma ya yi amfani da shi wajen koyar da’ yan Skinnerian don ya shafe su fiye da bala’i huɗu.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.	Babu shakka, abin da ya faru shi ne cewa mun saka wannan a fili, ko kuma a wasu wurare, muna saka tufafi da kuma duwatsu a kewaye.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.	Kuma daga baya, sai ka ci daga kaburbura kuma ka yi amfani da shi wajen.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.	Daga baya, suna cin dukan kaburbura.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.	Sai suka ga cewa da akwai kaburbura a kan ƙafafun kuma suna ɗokin samun taimako.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.	Sa'an nan sunã barin(wurãren) faƙo da ƙawa, kuma su yi wãsa da ƙawa da ƙawa, kuma rãyuwar dũniya ba ta zama mai sãɓo ba, idan sun kasance daga        		0.00	0.00	35.00
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.	Sa’an nan za ka iya dawowa kuma ka yi tsaro.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.	Saboda haka, sa’ad da aka yi amfani da su da gaske, mun ƙaura zuwa gidajen da ke zuwa.		0.00	0.00	18.00
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.	Sai suka tafi sunã shãwara a ɓõye(sunã cẽwa). Kuma suka jũya sunã mãsu bãyar da bãya, kuma suka kangẽwa daga kaburbura.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.	Kuma idan sun yi farin ciki sosai game da wannan, za mu ci gaba kuma mu sa su farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.	Ƙari ga haka, mun ƙaura zuwa wani wuri na uku, inda muke ba su abinci.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.	Yanzu, kamar yawancinmu da suka yi amfani da wani abu mai kyau, wannan yana sa su baƙin ciki.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.	Saboda haka, suna yin abin da suke yi sa’ad da suke neman wani abu, suna kuka daga hanyar da suke yi.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.	Kuma suna yin haka a nan, kuma suna ƙwanƙwasa sanyi, kuma idan hakan ya faru, sai su sami daji.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And so this goes on for some time.	Kuma hakan ya faru a kai a kai.		0.00	0.00	8.00
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.	Labaran sun koyi cewa dukan abubuwan da suke bukata su yi, suna jiran jirgin ruwa da za su fito, su yi sanyi, sai su shiga cikin duwatsu.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.	Ƙari ga haka, sa’ad da suke da kyakkyawan abinci da kuma ta’aziyya, za mu ƙaura zuwa masauki na ƙarshe, kuma babu abin da ya faru.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.	Kuma wannan wurin ne muke ganin bambancin tsakanin dokoki da wasu dabbobi.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.	Alal misali, mujallu za su nuna, su nemi tsari, su tafi.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.	Ku koma, ku nemi tsari, ku tafi.		0.00	0.00	7.00
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.	Suna yin hakan sau da yawa kafin su yi fushi, sai suka tafi kuma suka yi waƙa.		0.00	0.00	17.00
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.	A wani ɓangaren kuma, suka tashi, suka yi ƙoƙari su kawar da shi.		0.00	0.00	13.00
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.	Sun san cewa wannan mujallar tana tare da su, ta wurin ƙauyuka uku.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.	Sai suka yi gaugawa a cikinta, kuma suka yi dũbi, da abin da bã ya yankẽwa.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.	Sai waɗansu' yan bãya suka maye a bãyansu, suka ce:" Ku yi izgili gare shi, sa'an nan ku zauna a cikin ƙasa, sa'an nan ku ɓuɓɓugar da shi ɓuɓɓugarwa."		0.00	0.00	29.00
And then, we're off to the races.	Sa'an nan, lalle ne, dã Mun kãtse masa lakã.                                    		0.00	0.00	44.00
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.	Wannan ƙaramin yana morewa na ɗan lokaci, har sai abokansa suka kammala yadda za su yi, sai muka tafi.		0.00	0.00	19.00
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.	Saboda haka, abin da ya fi muhimmanci a gare ni shi ne cewa ba za mu iya koyar da littattafai don mu ɗauki kayayyaki ba.		0.00	0.00	25.00
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.	Kusan biliyan 216 ne suka yi hasarar kowace shekara, amma ban tabbata cewa zan iya dogara ga Jehobah ba.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger.	Maimakon haka, ina tunanin cewa ya kamata mu ɗauki mataki da yawa.		0.00	0.00	12.00
I think that crows can be trained to do other things.	Ina ganin cewa za a iya koyar da littattafai su yi wasu abubuwa.		0.00	0.00	13.00
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?	Alal misali, me ya sa ba za ka koyar da su su su ɗauki tufafi bayan abubuwan da suka faru ba?		0.00	0.00	21.00
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics?	Ko kuma ka sami kayan aiki masu kyau daga telibijin?		0.00	0.00	10.00
Or maybe do search and rescue?	Ko kuwa za ka yi bincike da kuma ceto?		0.00	0.00	9.00
The main thing, the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species.	Abin da ya fi muhimmanci shi ne, ainihin dalilin da ya sa na samu wannan shi ne cewa za mu iya samun tsari na musamman don waɗannan abubuwa.		0.00	0.00	28.00
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn't involve exterminating them, but involves finding an equilibrium with them that's a useful balance.	Za mu iya samun hanyoyi da za mu yi la’akari da waɗannan batutuwa da ba za su iya kawar da su ba, amma hakan ya ƙunshi kasancewa da daidaita da su.		0.00	0.00	31.00

And by parallel summary, I want to say the same thing about technology, about entertainment and design, because I think the issues are very similar.

Well, for more than 60 years, psychology worked within the disease model.	Fiye da shekara 60, mutane sun yi aiki a cikin rashin lafiya.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Ten years ago, when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate, and told them what I did, they'd move away from me.

And because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you.	To, sabõda abin da suka aikata daga alhẽri, sunã cẽwa, lalle ne sunã da alfãsha da abin da bã shi da kyau.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And now, when I tell people what I do, they move toward me.	Kuma yanzu, sa’ad da na gaya wa mutane abin da nake yi, suna ƙaura zuwa wurina.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And what was good about psychology, about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology, is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors.	Kuma abin da yake da kyau game da alama, kusan biliyan 30 da aka gayyaci NIMH ya yi, game da yin aiki a cikin cuta, game da abin da kake nufi, shekaru 60 da suka shige, babu wani cikin waɗanda suka wulaƙanci da suka wulaƙanci da kuma mu’ujiza.		0.00	0.00	48.00
And now, 14 of the disorders are treatable, two of them actually curable.	Kuma yanzu, mutane 14 da suka ƙi bin umurnin da aka ba su, ɗaya daga cikinsu suna da lada.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness.	Kuma wani abu da ya faru shi ne cewa kimiyya ta kasance, kimiyya na rashin lafiya.		0.00	0.00	16.00
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor.	Mun gano cewa za mu iya yin baƙin ciki kamar baƙin ciki, shan giya, da kuma gwada su.		0.00	0.00	18.00
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses.	Domin mu halicci kasawar jiki.                                                                   		0.00	0.00	71.00
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.	Domin mu fahimci cewa rashin lafiya ne.		0.00	0.00	7.00
We could look across time at the same people -- people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.	Alal misali, za mu iya ɗaukan lokaci ɗaya da mutane da yawa, waɗanda ba sa iya yin amfani da kuɗin da ake bayarwa, kuma mu tambayi abin da ake bayarwa, kuma za mu iya yin kasuwanci dabam-dabam ta wajen yin hakan.		0.00	0.00	41.00
And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.	Ƙari ga haka, mun yi shekaru hamsin da suka shige, don mu kawar da itatuwa da itatuwa na alama.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random assignment, placebo controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.	Bayan haka, mun iya gwada su sosai, a wurin aiki mai kyau, a wurin aiki mai wuya, sai mu jefa abubuwa da ba su dace ba, sai mu ƙyale abubuwa da suka yi.		0.00	0.00	33.00
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years, can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.	Kuma kammala wannan shi ne cewa mutane da yawa ba sa son su yi kuskure, fiye da shekaru 60, za su iya da’awar cewa za mu iya yin kuskure.		0.00	0.00	29.00
And I think that's terrific.	" Kuma inã zaton maganarta, alhãli kuwa inã                                                                 		0.00	0.00	72.00
But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.	Amma abin da bai dace ba, sakamakon haka ne abubuwa uku.		0.00	0.00	11.00
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.	Na farko shi ne ɗabi’a na farko,’ yan siyasa da shugabannin addinai sun zama masu cin amana,’ yan siyasa, domin ra’ayinmu na’ yan adam shi ne cewa idan kana cikin wahala, duwatsu suka faɗa maka.		0.00	0.00	35.00
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.	Kuma mun manta cewa mutane sun yi zaɓi da shawarwari.		0.00	0.00	10.00
We forgot responsibility.	Mun mance da hakki.		0.00	0.00	4.00
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.	Na biyu shi ne cewa mun manta da kai.		0.00	0.00	9.00
We forgot about improving normal lives.	Mun mance game da kyautata rayuwar banza.		0.00	0.00	7.00
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive.	Mun mance game da aikin da za mu yi don mu sa mutane su yi farin ciki sosai, kuma hakan ya                                                     		0.00	0.00	73.00
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.	Ƙari ga haka, matsalar ta uku game da cututtuka ita ce, idan muka yi wani abu game da mutane da suke wahala, za mu iya yin wani abu game da gyara, ba zai taɓa faruwa ba mu ɗauki mataki don mu sa mutane su yi farin ciki ba.		0.00	0.00	48.00
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.	Ƙari ga haka, abin da ya sa mutane kamar Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Ciksscmil da kaina suke aiki a wani abu da na kira wani abu mai kyau, wanda yake da shi uku.		0.00	0.00	34.00
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.	Na farko shi ne cewa ya kamata a mai da hankali kamar yadda yake damuwa da ƙarfinmu na’ yan Adam                                                    		0.00	0.00	71.00
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.	Ya kamata ya zama kamar yadda yake damuwa da gina ƙarfi da kuma gyara.		0.00	0.00	14.00
It should be interested in the best things in life.	Ya kamata ya so abubuwa da suka fi kyau a rayuwa.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.	Ƙari ga haka, ya kamata ya zama kamar yadda yake damuwa da rayuwar mutane da suke cika, da kuma gaskiya, da kuma fahariya.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.	Saboda haka, a shekara ta 10 da begen zuwa nan gaba, ka ga somawar kimiyya na zahiri, kimiyya na abin da ke sa rayuwa ta cancanta.		0.00	0.00	26.00
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.	Hakan ya sa mu kasance da farin ciki dabam.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And any of you, for free, can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.	Kuma daga cikinku akwai' yanta, kuma ku yi ɗaurin auren, kuma ku ɗauki dukan gwajin farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	17.00
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?	Za ka iya yin tambaya, ta yaya za ka kasance da juyayi mai kyau, da kuma ma’ana, da aka yi wa dubban mutane a zahiri?		0.00	0.00	25.00
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.	Mun gano cewa za mu iya fahimtar dalilin da ya sa ya dace, dangantakar da ke tsakanin aiki mai kyau da kuma aiki mai kyau da ke sa mu farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	31.00
I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question, how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?	Ina amfani da rayuwata wajen yin aiki a kan mutane masu fajirci, kuma na tambayi Hauwa’u, ta yaya mutane da yawa da suka bambanta da sauran mutane?		0.00	0.00	27.00
And starting about six years ago, we asked about extremely happy people.	Da muka soma shekaru shida da da suka shige, mun yi tambaya game da mutane masu farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And how do they differ from the rest of us?	Kuma ta yaya suka bambanta da sauran cikinmu?		0.00	0.00	8.00
And it turns out there's one way.	Kuma ta jẽfar da wata ãyã.		0.00	0.00	6.00
They're not more religious, they're not in better shape, they don't have more money, they're not better looking, they don't have more good events and fewer bad events.	Ba su ƙara bin addini ba, amma ba su da kuɗin da suka fi kyau, ba sa neman kuɗi, amma ba sa ganin abubuwa masu kyau da kuma munanan abubuwa.		0.00	0.00	30.00
They don't sit in seminars on Saturday morning.	Sun ba da gudummawa a ranar Lahadi.		0.00	0.00	7.00
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends.	Kowannensu yana cikin dangantaka na dindindin kuma kowanne yana da abokai masu arziki.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And I'm going to suggest to you that's not nearly enough, in just a moment.	" Kuma inã yi muku nasĩha, bã zã ta zo muku ba, fãce kaɗan."		0.00	0.00	14.00
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries, from the Buddha to Tony Robbins.	Muna iya soma kallon taron gunduma a ƙarnuka da yawa, daga Budha zuwa Tony Robers.		0.00	0.00	15.00
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy.	A taron gunduma 120 an tabbatar da cewa mutane suna farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.	Ƙari ga haka, mun ga cewa za mu iya manne wa yawancinsu, kuma mun yi aiki mai kyau da kuma yin nazarin Littafi Mai Tsarki da kyau.		0.00	0.00	27.00
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?	Wace gaskiya ce mutane suke sa mutane farin ciki?		0.00	0.00	9.00
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.	A cikin’ yan mintoci, na gaya maka game da wasu sakamako.		0.00	0.00	11.00
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?	Amma abin da nake so shi ne cewa aikin da nake so na yi, ba da ƙarin bayani game da shi ba, kuma a maimakon haka, za a iya hana mutane yin kuskure, hakan zai sa mutane su yi farin ciki?		0.00	0.00	41.00
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.	Kuma yin wannan tambayar ba maganar farin ciki ba ce da na yi amfani da ita a cikin abin da nake tsammani game da farin ciki ba.                                        		0.00	0.00	66.00
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.	Ƙari ga haka, na gaskata cewa akwai abubuwa uku da suka bambanta kuma na kira su domin taron gunduma dabam-dabam ya ƙarfafa su, maimakon su yi farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	28.00
The first happy life is the pleasant life.	Rayuwa ta farko ita ce rayuwa mai gamsarwa.		0.00	0.00	8.00
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it.	Wannan rãyuwa ce wadda kake da ita, kanã da juyayi kamar yadda kake so, da kuma kaburbura zuwa wurinta.		0.00	0.00	19.00
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.	Na biyu, rayuwarka ce ta musamman a aikinka, rabonka, ƙaunarka, lokacinka, lokacinka, lokacinka yana da muhimmanci a gare ka.		0.00	0.00	19.00
That's what Aristotle was talking about.	Abin da Aristos yake magana ne game da Aristotle                                                      		0.00	0.00	62.00
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.	Saboda haka, ina son in gaya wa kowanne cikin waɗannan rayuwar da kuma abin da muka sani game da su.		0.00	0.00	20.00
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.	Rayuwa ta farko ita ce rayuwa mai gamsarwa da kuma abin da ya fi kyau, kamar yadda za mu iya yin annashuwa, kamar yadda za ka iya ji, da kuma koyon abin da za ka iya yi, da kuma koyon abin da za ka iya sa su kasance da kwanciyar hankali.		0.00	0.00	51.00
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.	Amma rai mai daɗi yana da baki uku, kuma abin da ya sa ya dace ya zama mai farin ciki ba abin farin ciki ba ne kuma dalilin da ya sa ya yi hakan.		0.00	0.00	34.00
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.	Na farko shi ne cewa ya sa rayuwarka ta kasance da ma’ana mai kyau, abin da ya fi daɗi, yana da gado, kusan kashi 50, kuma hakan ba shi da sauƙi.		0.00	0.00	31.00
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.	Saboda haka, duwatsu sun bambanta da Matthiu [ Ricard ] da kuma wasu sun sani game da ƙaruwa mai kyau a rayuwarka.		0.00	0.00	22.00
Second is that positive emotion habituates.	Na biyu shi ne mazaunan kirki.		0.00	0.00	6.00
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.	Kamar Faransanci da ake kira French, wanda shi ne ɗan fari na farko, ya fi kilomita 100.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.	Kuma kamar yadda na ce," Bã ya yiwuwa a gare ku, ku yi haƙuri.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And this leads to the second life.	Kuma wannan yana kai ga rãyuwa ta biyu.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And I have to tell you about my friend, Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure.	Ƙari ga haka, na gaya maka game da abokina, Len, don in yi magana game da dalilin da ya sa ya dace ya zama mai kyau, fiye da jin daɗi.		0.00	0.00	30.00
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful.	A cikin waɗannan wurare uku na rayuwa, a lokacin Len, Len ya yi nasara sosai.		0.00	0.00	15.00
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.	A lokacin da yake ɗan shekara 20, ya zama shugaba.		0.00	0.00	10.00
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company.	A lokacin da yake ɗan shekara 25, yana da dubu da kuma kan takardar da ake koyar da su.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Second, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.	Na biyu, a kamfanin wasanni na ƙasashe.		0.00	0.00	7.00
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.	Amma a cikin babban birni na uku na rayuwa, ƙauna, Len ba shi da iyaka.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.	Kuma dalilin da ya sa ya zama, Len kifi ne mai sanyi.		0.00	0.00	12.00
American women said to Len, when he dated them, "You're no fun.	Kuma waɗansu mãtã suka ce wa Lũɗu, a lõkacin da ya ce musu," Bã zã ku yi yãƙi ba."		0.00	0.00	19.00
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.	Ƙari ga haka, Len yana da arziki sosai da zai iya sa wani Bayanin Park Avenupale ya yi shekaru biyar da suka yi ƙoƙari ya sami jima’i da ya yi.		0.00	0.00	30.00
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.	Amma ta fito a wurin ba ta yin jima’i ba.		0.00	0.00	10.00
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.	Hakan ya sa Len-Len ya yi girma a Long Island kuma ya yi kiwon dutse, kuma ya yi wa Len-Len da ke cikin kabari biyar na abin da muke kiransu.		0.00	0.00	30.00
The question is, is Len unhappy?	Tambayar ita ce, Len ba farin ciki ba ne?		0.00	0.00	9.00
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.	Akasin abin da aka gaya mana game da’ yan Adam kusan kashi 50 na’ yan Adam, ina tunanin Len yana ɗaya daga cikin mutane masu farin ciki da na sani.		0.00	0.00	30.00
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.	Kuma kada ku nakasa wa mutãne abũbuwansu a cikin Jahannama, kuma amma fãsiƙanci ne, kuma mafi yawanku sun kasance mãsu babban rabo.		0.00	0.00	22.00
When the first card is played, until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.	Lokacin da aka yi aiki na farko, har kwanaki 10 bayan haka, mai suna Len yana da muhimmanci sosai.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow.	Kuma lalle ne, wannan shi ne abin da Mike Csikicsmil yake magana game da kaburbura.                                        		0.00	0.00	54.00
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.	Amma abin da Mike ya gaya maka a lokacin cin abinci, ba za ka ji ba.		0.00	0.00	16.00
You're one with the music.	Kouppre da waƙa.		0.00	0.00	3.00
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.	Kuma waccan ita ce sifar abin da muke zato game da rayuwa mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are.	" Kuma lalle ne mũ, mun yi zato a gare shi, kuma mun san abin da yake mafi girma daga ƙarfinku."		0.00	0.00	21.00
And again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are.	" Sa'an nan kuma wata sifa irinta ta kasance a gare ku, da abin da kuka kasance kunã aikatãwa."		0.00	0.00	19.00
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.	Saboda haka, ka yi amfani da rayuwarka don ka yi amfani da su yadda za ka iya yin amfani da su.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.	Ka yi amfani da aikinka, ƙaunarka, ka yi abokantaka, abotarka, da yaranka.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Just one example.	Ga misali ɗaya.		0.00	0.00	3.00
She's working her way through college.	Matar Shellege ta yi aiki                                                                                 		0.00	0.00	85.00
Her highest strength was social intelligence, so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day.

But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.	Amma abin da ta yi zai ƙarfafa ta sosai, kuma ta yi amfani da su yadda ya yiwu.		0.00	0.00	18.00
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.	Abin da ka fita daga wannan ba shi da tawali’u.		0.00	0.00	10.00

So, that's the second path.	Sabõda haka, hanyar Allah(ta gyaran jama'a).                                                                            		0.00	0.00	81.00
The second path is eudaimonian flow.	Hanya ta biyu ita ce hanya ta biyu da za a                                                                              		0.00	0.00	88.00
And the third path is meaning.	Hanya ta uku tana da ma’ana.		0.00	0.00	6.00
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.	Wannan shi ne abu mafi kyau na farin ciki, na farko.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.	Ƙari ga haka, a wannan ra’ayin, yana ɗauke da darajar ido da ido da ya ƙunshi sanin abin da ya fi ƙarfinka, kuma yana amfani da su a hidimar wani abu mafi muhimmanci fiye da kai.		0.00	0.00	36.00
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question, are there things that lastingly change those lives?	Na ambata cewa dukan abubuwa uku na rayuwa, rayuwa mai kyau, rayuwa mai ma’ana, rayuwa mai ma’ana, mutane a yanzu suna aiki tuƙuru a kan tambaya, akwai abubuwa da suke canja rayuwarsu?		0.00	0.00	32.00
And the answer seems to be yes.	Kuma hakan ya zama E.		0.00	0.00	5.00
It's being done in a rigorous manner.	Kamar wancan ne aka ƙawãta wa'azi mai girma                                                                             		0.00	0.00	84.00
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.	Hakazalika, kamar yadda muke fuskantar gwaji don mu ga abin da ke da muhimmanci.		0.00	0.00	14.00
So we do random assignment, placebo controlled, long-term studies of different interventions.	Saboda haka, muna ba da aiki mai kyau, mu yi nazarin Littafi Mai Tsarki na dogon lokaci.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.	Ƙari ga haka, idan muka koya wa mutane game da rayuwa mai ma’ana, za mu yi farin ciki a rayuwarka, ɗaya daga cikin aikinka shi ne ka ɗauki matakin da za ka ɗauka da gaggawa, kuma ka yi hidima a wata rana mai kyau.                                  		0.00	0.00	77.00
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.	Bayan haka, ka kafa ranar Asabar, ka kafa rana mai kyau, ka yi amfani da rana mai kyau, kuma ka yi amfani da su don ka kyautata waɗannan abubuwan.		0.00	0.00	29.00
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.	Ƙari ga haka, za mu iya nuna cewa rayuwa mai ma’ana ce.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Gratitude visit.	Gratus ya ziyarce shi.		0.00	0.00	4.00
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked.	Ka yi ƙoƙari ka tuna da wanda ya yi wani abu mai muhimmanci da ya canja rayuwarka a hanya mai kyau, kuma ba ka taɓa godiya ba.		0.00	0.00	27.00
The person has to be alive.	Mutumin yana da rai.		0.00	0.00	4.00
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.	Yanzu, za ka iya buɗe idanunka.		0.00	0.00	6.00
I hope all of you have such a person.	Dukanku muna da irin wannan mutumin.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door, you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.	Aikinka, sa’ad da kake koyon wannan ziyarar, yana da muhimmanci ka rubuta wasiƙa ta 300 ga mutumin da ke Phoix, ka tambaye su ko za ka iya ziyartar su, ka ba su dalilin da ya sa ka nuna musu cewa kana karatun ƙofa, ka karanta labarinsu ko kuma ka karanta shaidu-shaidu-shaidu da kowane mako da ya faru.		0.00	0.00	57.00
And what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.	Kuma abin da ya faru sa’ad da muka gwada mutane a mako ɗaya, wata uku bayan haka, sai wata uku, suka yi farin ciki kuma suka yi baƙin ciki.		0.00	0.00	29.00
Another example is a strength date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths, and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.	Wani misali kuma shi ne ƙarfinmu, wanda muke da ma’aurata su fahimci abubuwa mafi muhimmanci a kan gwaji, sa’an nan kuma su zama yamma da suke amfani da su, kuma muna samun wannan dangantaka mai ƙarfi.		0.00	0.00	36.00
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.	To, yãya musũNa(gare su) ya kasance a gare ku, dõmin mãsu yawa daga cikinku sun karkata zuwa ga ilimi?		0.00	0.00	19.00
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and to contrast it.	Amma, masu sauke karatu da kuma mutanen da nake aiki da gaggawa sun gano wannan, saboda haka, muna da mutane suna yin wani abu mai kyau kuma mu yi wani abu da bai dace ba.		0.00	0.00	35.00
And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set.	Kuma abin da kuka sãmu ganĩma, to, lalle ne, shi, gare shi, mai sauƙi ne.		0.00	0.00	15.00
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.	Sa’ad da ka yi wani abu da zai taimaka wa wani, sai ya yi baƙin ciki sosai.		0.00	0.00	17.00
So those are examples of positive interventions.	Saboda haka, waɗannan misalai ne na taron gunduma mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	10.00
So, the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.	Saboda haka, na ƙarshe na so in faɗi abin da ya fi gamsarwa da mutane suke da shi.                                                                    		0.00	0.00	85.00
And this is really what you're about.	Kuma abin da ya faru ke nan.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get?	Ƙari ga haka, mun yi tambaya game da rayuwar mutane uku, yaya rayuwa ta gamsar da kai?		0.00	0.00	17.00
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?	Saboda haka, mun yi farin ciki sosai sa’ad da muka yi hakan a waɗannan tambayoyin 15 da suka shafi dubban mutane da yawa, yaya biɗan rayuwa mai kyau, rayuwa mai gamsarwa, lokaci mai kyau, da zai sa ka kasance da ma’ana, kuma ka biɗi rayuwa mai gamsarwa?		0.00	0.00	47.00
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.	Sakamakonmu ya yi mamaki, amma sun ƙi abin da muke tunani.		0.00	0.00	11.00
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.	Yana mai da hankali ga biɗan annashuwa ba shi da isashen gamsuwa.                                                                      		0.00	0.00	81.00
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.	Abin da ya fi muhimmanci shi ne mafi muhimmanci.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.	Samun kuɗi yana da ƙarfi sosai.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.	Idan kun yarda da abin da ya sauƙaƙa, kuma kuka yi gũrin, to, ku nẽmi yarda da abin da ya sauƙaƙa na hadaya.		0.00	0.00	23.00
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.	Wadda za ta ce, rayuwa ta cikakken lokaci ita ce fiye da rabi, idan mutum ya yi dubu uku.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.	To, idan ba ku da wani rai guda uku, to, rãyuwa ba ta zama ba fãce tãtsũniyõyin.                             		0.00	0.00	45.00
And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?	Kuma mene ne ya kamata ka yi a yanzu shi ne dangantaka ta jiki, lafiyar jiki, dogon ɗabi’a, har tsawon lokacin da kake zama kuma ka bi wannan dangantakar?		0.00	0.00	29.00
That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?	Saboda haka, a wani wuri, ana ba da haɗin kai na motsin rai da kuma ma’ana?		0.00	0.00	16.00
Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life?	Shin rashin lafiya yana da kyau, farin ciki, da kuma ma’ana a rayuwa?		0.00	0.00	13.00
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.	Ƙari ga haka, akwai dalili na yin tunani a kan amsar da waɗannan za su                                        		0.00	0.00	54.00
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me.	Saboda haka, Chris ya ce mai jawabi na ƙarshe yana da zarafin fahimtar abin da ya ji, kuma hakan ya sa ni mamaki.		0.00	0.00	23.00
I've never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much, which was one of the remarkable things.	Bai taɓa ganin masu jawabi da yawa ba, wadda take cikin abubuwa masu ban al’ajabi.		0.00	0.00	15.00
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.	Amma na gano cewa matsalolin da ake fuskanta a duniya kamar ba daidai ba ne ga matsalolin telibijin, nishaɗi da kuma yin aiki a hanyar da ta biy                   		0.00	0.00	46.00
We all know that technology, entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes.	Dukanmu mun san cewa nishaɗi, nishaɗi da kuma yadda aka yi amfani da su don a halaka nufe-nufen                           		0.00	0.00	44.00
We also know that technology, entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery.	Ƙari ga haka, mun san cewa za a iya yin amfani da nishaɗi da kuma irin nishaɗi.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important.	Ƙari ga haka, bambancin da ke tsakanin kawar da kuskure da kuma farin ciki yana da muhimmanci sosai.		0.00	0.00	18.00
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.	Na yi tunani, sa’ad da na zama marubucin shekara 30 da suka shige, cewa idan ina da kyakkyawan abin da zan yi wa wani rashin lafiya, ban yi fushi ba, amma na sa su farin ciki.		0.00	0.00	36.00
And I never found that.	Kuma ban samu hakan ba.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery.	Ƙari ga haka, yana sa mutane su yi farin ciki kuma su yi farin ciki sosai.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.	Ƙari ga haka, abin da ke faruwa da nishaɗi da kuma na yi imani da shi.		0.00	0.00	16.00
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion, and that's typically how they've been used.	Saboda haka, zai yiwu waɗannan makiyaya uku na duniya su ƙara farin ciki, su ƙara jin daɗi, da kuma yadda aka yi amfani da su.		0.00	0.00	25.00
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough -- there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.	Sa'an nan idan kun ƙãre ayyukan hajji, to, bãbu laifi a kanku a cikin rãyuwar dũniya kuma bã zã ku yi farin ciki ba.		0.00	0.00	24.00
As Laura Lee told us, design, and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.	Kamar yadda Laura Lee ta gaya mana, alhali, kuma na gaskata, nishaɗi da wasanni, za a iya yin amfani da shi don in sami ƙarin bayani a rayuwa.		0.00	0.00	28.00
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet.	Saboda haka, idan muka kammala, dalili na bakwai na yin kuskure, fiye da yadda zan yi tunani a kan abubuwan da nake yi, nishaɗi, nishaɗi, da kuma yadda za mu iya ƙara yawan farin cikin’ yan Adam.		0.00	0.00	37.00
And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.	Ƙari ga haka, idan ba za a iya yin hakan ba, a shekaru biyu ko biyu, za a ƙara rayuwa mai gamsarwa, rai mai kyau da kuma rayuwa mai ma’ana, zai fi kyau.		0.00	0.00	33.00
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.	Idan za a iya kawar da nishaɗi mai kyau, ma’ana, da kuma ma’ana, za ta kasance da kyau.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaimonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.	Ƙari ga haka, idan wani abu zai iya sa mutum ya yi baƙin ciki, idanu, da kuma ma’ana, abin da za su yi tare zai zama abin da ya dace.		0.00	0.00	30.00
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point is an economic tipping point.	Ƙari ga haka, za a iya yin amfani da kashi hamsin da aka yi a ko’ina.		0.00	0.00	16.00
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.	An yi amfani da shi cewa Paris da London da New York ne birane mafi girma.		0.00	0.00	16.00
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West.	Abin da muke da shi yanzu shi ne ƙarshen mafi girma.		0.00	0.00	11.00

The dawn of books is, of course, important.	Hakika, safe na littattafai yana da muhimmanci.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.	Kuma ba ya son yin magana game da yamma na littattafai ba tare da samun Littafi Mai Tsarki na Gutberg.		0.00	0.00	20.00

But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology, is not the book.	Amma abin da yake so game da Littafi Mai Tsarki na Gutkiberg, da yamma na wannan karin, ba littafin ba ne.		0.00	0.00	21.00
You see, the book was not driven by reading.	Ka ga cewa ba a binne littafin ba.		0.00	0.00	8.00
So why did the printing press succeed?	Saboda haka, me ya sa sarakunan suka yi nasara?		0.00	0.00	9.00
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.	Wannan shi ne shafi na asali na Littafi Mai Tsarki na Jamus.		0.00	0.00	12.00
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books using movable type in the history of man, 550 years ago.	Saboda haka, ka duba ɗaya daga cikin littattafai na farko da aka buga a cikin tarihin mutum, shekaru 550 da suka shige.		0.00	0.00	22.00

But why is this so interesting?	Amma me ya sa hakan yake da muhimmanci?		0.00	0.00	8.00
It turns out that in the 1450s, the Catholic Church needed money, and so they actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences, which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.	Ya juya cewa a shekara ta 14500000008, Cocin Katolika suna bukatar kuɗi, saboda haka, sun rubuta waɗannan abubuwan da ake kira mazansu, wanda aka hana su yin hakan.		0.00	0.00	28.00
They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.	Sun je ko’ina a ƙasar Turai kuma suka sayar da dubbai ko kuma dubbai.		0.00	0.00	14.00
They got you out of purgatory faster.	Sunã yi maka fatawa.		0.00	0.00	4.00
And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences, which was the equivalent of printing money.	To, a lõkacin da aka ɗimautar da su da abin da aka same su, suka buga ƙeƙasassu, sai suka yi nauyi ga dukkan mai buga littattafai.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 -- to print out thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of single, small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.

So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen, was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading.	Saboda haka, sarakunan, raunana da kuma ƙafafun mutane, an tuɓe su ta wajen buga littattafai na dā kuma babu abin da zai yi da karatu.		0.00	0.00	25.00

And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.	Ƙari ga haka, dukan waɗannan abubuwa dabam-dabam sun bambanta.		0.00	0.00	9.00

So it’s a leap of imagination.	Saboda haka, jikin siffa.		0.00	0.00	4.00
So hopefully tomorrow I’ll show one or two more objects from the stage, but for today I just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it.

And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.	Kuma abin da ke faruwa da kuma siffarsa yana da muhimmanci.                                         		0.00	0.00	51.00
For example, we can look at a DNA molecule model here.	Alal misali, za mu iya duba wata DNA da ta kashe kuɗi a nan.		0.00	0.00	14.00
None of us really have ever seen one, but we know it exists because we’ve been taught to understand this molecule.	Babu wani cikinmu da gaske, amma mun san cewa hakan ya faru domin mun san cewa mun yi farin ciki sosai don mun fahimci wannan sarautar.		0.00	0.00	26.00
But we can also look at an Enigma machine from the Nazis in World War II that was a coding and decoding machine.	Amma za mu iya yin la’akari da wani bincike na Ingila daga ƙasar Nazi a Yaƙin Duniya na biyu da ya dace kuma ya tsai da shawara mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	29.00
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?	Yanzu, za ka iya cewa, menene wannan yake da muhimmanci a yi                                          		0.00	0.00	53.00
Well, this is the code for life, and this is a code for death.	To, wannan shi ne gidan rai, kuma wannan shi ne makõma ga mutuwa.		0.00	0.00	13.00
These two molecules code and decode.	Waɗannan halaye biyu masu kyau da kuma matsayi.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.	Kuma ka dũba zuwa gare su, shin, kanã ganin wani tsãni ne da aka rãyar da shi?		0.00	0.00	17.00
But once you’ve seen them in a new way, you realize that both of these things really are connected.	Amma idan ka gan su a wata hanya, ka fahimci cewa waɗannan abubuwa suna da muhimmanci sosai.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.	Ƙari ga haka, ba haka ba ne domin wannan.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You see, this is a human brain model, OK?	Ka ga cewa wannan halin ɗan Adam ne, OK.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.	Ƙari ga haka, domin ba mu taɓa ganin ruwan sama ba.		0.00	0.00	11.00
We get to see a skull.	Za mu ga wani kamfani.		0.00	0.00	5.00
All of imagination -- everything that we think, we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.	Dukan abubuwan da muke tsammani, muna ji, muna ganin cewa muna da ra’ayin’ yan Adam.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And once we create new patterns in this brain, once we shape the brain in a new way, it never returns to its original shape.	Kuma muddin mun halicci sababbin fasaloli a wannan garin, muddin muna shafan ruwa a sabuwar hanya, ba za ta sake dawowa ba.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And I’ll give you a quick example.	Kuma in ba ka misali mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	7.00
We think about the Internet; we think about information that goes across the Internet.	Mun yi tunani game da Intane ; muna tunani game da bayanai da suka shafi Intane.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And we never think about the hidden connection.	" Kuma ba mu yi zaton ɓatarwa ba."		0.00	0.00	8.00
But I brought along here a lump of coal -- right here, one lump of coal.	Amma na zo wurare masu kyau a nan, ɗaya daga cikin jirgin ruwa.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?	Kuma mene ne ya kamata mu yi da Intane?		0.00	0.00	9.00
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net.	Za ka ga cewa ana bukatar kuɗin da aka yi a wani wuri don ka ƙaura wata hanyar da za a yi amfani da ita don ka yi bincike.		0.00	0.00	29.00
So every time you download a file, each megabyte is a lump of coal.	Saboda haka, a duk lokacin da kake shan ƙwayoyi, kowacce hanya ce mai kyau.		0.00	0.00	14.00
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file looks like this, ladies and gentlemen.	Abin da wannan yake nufi shi ne,’ yan sanda 200 da suke kallo kamar wannan, raɓa da kuma ƙafafun mutane.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So the next time you download a gigabyte, or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?	Saboda haka, da shigewar lokaci ka yi amfani da’ yancin kai, ko kuma’ yancin kai biyu, OK?		0.00	0.00	17.00
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web , and to make everything we think possible, possible.	Kasancewa da gaggawa yana bukatar ya halaka auren, kuma ya sa dukan abin da muke tsammani, zai yiwu.		0.00	0.00	18.00
I'm giving a short slide show this morning that I'm giving for the very first time, so -- well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar, I'm actually trying to lower the bar.

And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong's fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief, but about behavior.	Ƙari ga haka, Karen Armer ya tuna mini cewa addinin ƙarya ba gaskiya ba ne, amma game da hamayya.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.	Wataƙila ya kamata mu faɗi irin wannan batun.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.	A wasu lokuta, a wasu lokuta ana nuna cewa imani ne, mai hikima.		0.00	0.00	13.00
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said, "You must become the change you wish to see in the world."	Kuma a lõkacin da ¦ ãgũtu suka ce:" Lalle ne, haƙĩƙa, kunã jẽ wa alfãsha wadda kuka kasance a cikin ƙasa."		0.00	0.00	21.00
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior.	Kuma ãƙibar waɗanda suka yi nufin wani mũgun shiri ta kasance bã zã a halittar ĩmãni ba fãce da gaskiya.		0.00	0.00	20.00
I'm a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids, and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house, and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.

But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs, it is more important to change the laws.	Amma, kamar yadda yake da muhimmanci a canja budurwoyi, ya fi muhimmanci a canja dokokin.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives, we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part.	Kuma sa’ad da muka canja halinmu a rayuwarmu ta yau da kullum, a wasu lokuta muna barin gidan da kuma shan wahala.		0.00	0.00	22.00

It tells the story of Sputnik, and the story of what happened to America as a result.	Ya gaya wa labarin Sutnik, kuma labarin abin da ya faru da Amirka domin haka.		0.00	0.00	15.00
For days after the launch, Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.	Shekaru da yawa bayan da aka kashe shi, Sutnik yana da ban al’ajabi.		0.00	0.00	13.00
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens, it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space.	’ Yan adam da ba su taɓa ganinsu ba, ya hure su kuma su yi fahariya cewa’ yan Adam ba su da wani abin da ya faru.		0.00	0.00	27.00
But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday, the media and the politicians told us, and we believed, that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology, and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs, using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.	Amma bayan kwana uku, a ranar da suka kira Rifkatu, siyasa da’ yan siyasa sun gaya mana, kuma mun gaskata cewa Sutnik magabtanmu sun yi mamagabtanmu a kimiyya da kuma kimiyya, kuma za su iya kai mu kai wa Rifkatu haragen da ke birnin Immmmmmmmmma.		0.00	0.00	45.00

But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation, into something that was overall very good for America.	Amma kuma ya nuna yadda za mu iya juya abin da ke faruwa a yanayi marar kyau, cikin wani abu da ya fi kyau ga Amirka.		0.00	0.00	26.00

And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.	Ƙari ga haka,’ yan tarihi a ƙasar U.S.		0.00	0.00	8.00
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer than the familiar families.	Kuma a Western Turai suna ƙoƙari su kasance da dangantaka na dogon lokaci, biliyoyi da suka daɗe suna wucewa.		0.00	0.00	19.00

And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads.	A Santa Fe Fe Fitse da kuma Moscow, ina son in ga inda hakan yake ja-gora.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago?	Yana kai ga wani likita 20, shekaru 25,000 da suka shige?		0.00	0.00	11.00

How far back does that go?	A wane lokaci ne hakan ya faru                                                                                   		0.00	0.00	89.00
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?	Yawancin shekaru dubbai ne suka shige?		0.00	0.00	6.00
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.	Ba zan yi imani da dukan waɗannan abubuwa ba kuma ba su da yare na zamani.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.	Saboda haka, zan yi mamaki cewa tushen makasudi da aka yi a gabashin nan da nan ya fi muhimmanci.		0.00	0.00	19.00
But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind.
