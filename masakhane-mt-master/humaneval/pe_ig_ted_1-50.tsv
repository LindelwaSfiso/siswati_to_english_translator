And being the youngest of seven, I have never been at the front of the line for anything.	Ebe ọ bụ na m dị afọ asaa, anọbeghị m n’ihu ihe ọ bụla.	Dika nwa ikpeazụ n’ime ụmụ asaa, anọbeghị m n’ihu ihe ọ bụla.	51.29	57.91	0.58

I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays, and I got a good look at them.	Ahụrụ m dọkịta ahụ, o nyekwara m X-rays ụfọdụ, ahụkwara m ha nke ọma.	Ahụrụ m dọkịta ahụ, o nyekwara m X-rays ụfọdụ, ahụkwara m ha nke ọma.	100.00	100.00	0.00

Hey, are you from Canada?	Ego, ì si Canada?	Hee, ì si Canada?	75.98	73.31	0.25
So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.	N’ihi ya, na mberede, m na-asụgharị amaokwu ọ bụla iji mee ka ihe ndị e dere na ya ghara ịdị mma.	Ya bụ mba, ozugbo a, ọdịghịzi m ka ihe ọjọọ idụpụ mmadu na ahịrị.	0.00	18.30	1.29

No, no.	Ee e, ee e.	Mba, mba.	0.00	4.17	2.00
So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt, because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.

In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign that said, "Volunteers Needed."

Yeah.	Yeka.	Yaa.	0.00	25.67	1.00
So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest, I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.

Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.	Leonardo bụ nwoke nke dọtara ihe nile gburugburu ya.		0.00	0.00	9.00

So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time.	N’ihi ya, n’ezie, ọ ga-abụrịrị na onye a ma ama dị ka Leonardo na-egosi onwe ya site n’oge ruo n’oge.		0.00	0.00	20.00

I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.	Echere m na ọ bụrụ na anyị ga-edili ọrụ ya nile ma na-achọ àgwà ndị na-egosi onwe anyị, anyị ga-ahụ ihu ya na-ele anyị anya.		0.00	0.00	25.00

There are about 120, you see them here.	E nwere ihe dị ka 120, ị na-ahụ ha n’ebe a.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?	Olee ndị nke a pụrụ ịbụ ndị na-egosipụta njide onwe onye?		0.00	0.00	11.00

So we can eliminate all the profiles.	Ya mere, anyị pụrụ iwepụ mgbasa nile ahụ.		0.00	0.00	8.00
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.	A ghaghị ịkọwa ya n’ụzọ zuru ezu.		0.00	0.00	7.00

So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.	N’ihi ya, anyị nwekwara ike iwepụ ndị agadi ma ọ bụ ndị na-elekọta ha.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Yes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.	Ee, n’ezie, nwoke ochie ahụ nọ n’ebe ahụ, dị ka a ma ama nke a na-ese onyinyo Vitruvianus.		0.00	0.00	18.00

Before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.	Tupu anyị agawa n’ihu ndị a, m kwesịrị ịkọwara ya ihe mere ụfọdụ ndị ji kwesị ikwu banyere ha.		0.00	0.00	19.00

And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.

There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.	Ọ dịghị ihe mere àgwà ndị a ji kwesị ilekwasị anya.		0.00	0.00	11.00
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait, and look, they are very similar.	Nanị ihe anyị mere bụ ịchọpụta àgwà ndị nwere àgwà ndị na-egosi njide onwe onye, ma lee, ha yiri nke ahụ.		0.00	0.00	21.00

Yes, it does.	Ee, ọ na-eme.		0.00	0.00	3.00
So we have three pictures, potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time.	N’ihi ya, anyị nwere foto atọ, bụ́ nke dị nnọọ ka Leonardo n’oge ahụ.		0.00	0.00	14.00

And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.	Nanị ihe osise Leonardo na-anakwerekwa bụ ihe e ji mara Leonardo.		0.00	0.00	11.00

Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide, so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us, and not only to supply the materials on bobbins, but to produce to our color specifications.

And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors, doesn't just make people feel a little better, it actually improves the quality of patient care and enables hospitals to run well.

Ya mere, otu n’ime oké ọhịa ndị kasị buo ibu na Mahadum Manchester, Ernest Rutherford, chọtara banyere nuklius, n’otu oge, kwuru na sayensị nile bụ ndị dọkịta ma ọ bụ ndị na-achịkọta ihe.		0.00	0.00	33.00
Now, I don't think he meant to insult the rest of science, although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.	Ugbu a, m na-eche na ya bu n’uche ịkpọtụ sayensị ndị ọzọ, ọ bụ ezie na o si New Zealand, n’ihi ya, ọ ga-ekwe omume.		0.00	0.00	25.00
OK, we've discovered the particles, but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is -- really you've done stamp collecting.	E NWERE ya na ị chọpụtala isiokwu ndị a, ma ọ gwụla ma ị̀ ghọtara ihe mere i ji mara, ihe mere o ji dị otú ahụ bụ na ọ bụ ndị na-eto eto ka ị na-eme nke ọma.		0.00	0.00	39.00
Fortunately, we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern.	Ọ dị mma ịmara na o nwere ike ịbụ na anyị nwere otu n’ime ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị chọpụtarala na narị afọ nke iri abụọ, bụ́ ndị na-eme ka e nwee ụkpụrụ ahụ.		0.00	0.00	34.00
It's the Newton's laws, if you want, of particle physics.	Isiokwu ya bụ iwu ndị Newtony nyere, ma ọ bụrụ na ị chọrọ, akụkụ ahụ́ ndị metụtara ahụ́ ike.		0.00	0.00	19.00
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.	Osisi ndị a na-akpọ ndagwurugwu ahụ nke mara mma.		0.00	0.00	9.00
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt, which is always the sign of elegance.	Ị pụrụ ịrapara ya n’ihu ebe a na-akpọ T-shirt, bụ́ nke na-egosi mgbe nile na ọ bụ ihe ịrịba ama.		0.00	0.00	20.00
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.	Otú ọ dị, nkwekọrịta a na-eme ka i nwee ike ịgbakọta ihe nile na-abụghị ihe ndị na-eme n’eluigwe na ala.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle, you've got a big enough computer -- why DNA is the shape it is.

In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.	Dị ka ihe atụ, i kwesịrị iji aka gị kpebie ihe ị ga-eme.                                                		0.00	0.00	60.00

A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.	Onye ọ bụla nke na-agwa m okwu.		0.00	0.00	7.00
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ dịkwuo mfe, n’ezie, site n’ịtụfu otu n’ime ahịhịa ndị ahụ.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Basically, each of these terms refers to some of the particles.	N’ụzọ bụ́ isi, nke ọ bụla n’ime okwu ndị a na-ezo aka n’ụfọdụ n’ime isiokwu ndị a.		0.00	0.00	17.00
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.	Ya mere, ndị ahụ na-ezo aka na Ws, otú ha si rapara n’ahụ́.		0.00	0.00	13.00
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.	Ndị a na-elekọta ndị na-adịghị ike, ndị Zọs, otu ihe ahụ.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Higgs particles have not been discovered.	A chọpụtabeghị isiokwu ndị a.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.	N’ihi ya, ihe niile anyị nwere ike ime ma ọ bụrụ na e nweghị ihe ga-eme ka anyị nwee ike ime otú ahụ.		0.00	0.00	23.00
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.	Anyị nwere ogologo oge anyị ga-eji na-atụle ihe ndị dị mma.                                                  		0.00	0.00	60.00
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government, Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said, "If you guys can explain, in language a politician can understand, what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.	N’azụ n’afọ ndị 19800, mgbe anyị chọrọ ka ndị ọchịchị si n’Amerịka nweta ego, Margaret Thatcher, n’oge ahụ, o kwuru, ọ bụrụ na ị pụrụ ịkọwa, n’asụsụ onye ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị pụrụ ịghọta, ihe hel ọ bụ na ị na-eme, ị pụrụ inwe ego ahụ.		0.00	0.00	45.00
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."	Achọrọ m ịma ihe akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ a na-ekwu.		0.00	0.00	9.00
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.	Anyị bịakwara n’ụlọ akwụkwọ a, o yikwara ka ọ na-arụ ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.	Ọ dị mma, ihe ndị Higs na-eme bụ, ọ na-enye isiokwu ndị bụ́ isi.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.	Ihe osise ahụ bụkwa na eluigwe na ala dum nakwa na ọnụ ụzọ ahụ pụtara nnọọ mbara èzí, ọ pụtakwara m, ọ bụkwa n’ime gị ka eluigwe na ala dum jupụtara n’ihe a na-akpọ ubi Higgs.		0.00	0.00	36.00
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles.	Ihe e dere na ya bụ na ndị a nọ n’ọnụ ụlọ bụ isiokwu ndị dị na Higg                                                		0.00	0.00	65.00
Now when a particle moves through the universe, it can interact with these Higgs particles.	Ugbu a, mgbe akụkụ ahụ́ na-agafe n’eluigwe na ala, ọ pụrụ iso isiokwu ndị a dị na Higgs na-akpakọrịta.		0.00	0.00	19.00
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.	Ma cheedị echiche banyere onye ọ bụla na-adịghị agafe agafe n’ọnụ ụlọ.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Then everyone ignores them.	Mgbe ahụ, onye ọ bụla na-eleghara ha anya.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room.	Cheekwa echiche banyere onye dị oké mkpa na onye nwere ọgụgụ isi na-aga n’ọnụ ụlọ.		0.00	0.00	15.00
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.	Ndị mmadụ gbara ya gburugburu, a na-ewepụtakwa akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ha site n’ọnụ ụlọ ahụ.		0.00	0.00	15.00
It's almost like they get heavy.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ha dị arọ.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.	Ihe ndị a na-eme na-emekwa nnọọ otú ndị Higgs si arụ ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	12.00
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy, in a sense, and massive, because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.	Ihe osise ahụ bụ na kọmputa na ọrụ ndị dị n’ahụ́ gị nakwa n’eluigwe na ala bụ́ ndị anyị na-ahụ gburugburu anyị dị arọ, n’ụzọ dị ukwuu, nakwa n’ụzọ dị ịrịba ama, n’ihi na isiokwu ndị Higgs gbara ha gburugburu.		0.00	0.00	40.00
They're interacting with the Higgs field.	Ahụhụ na-emetụta ubi Higgs.		0.00	0.00	4.00
If that picture's true, then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.	Ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ emee, anyị aghaghị ịchọpụta isiokwu ndị ahụ dị na LHC.		0.00	0.00	15.00
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism, although it's the simplest we've been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC.	Ọ bụrụ na ọ bụghị otú ahụ ka ọ dị n’ihi na ihe ndị e dere na ya adịghị mma, ọ bụ ezie na ọ bụ ezie na ọ na-esiri anyị ike ichebara ihe ọ bụla anyị na-arụ n’isiokwu ndị dị na Higgs, bụ́ ndị anyị maara na anyị aghaghị ịgbaso na LHC echiche.		0.00	0.00	54.00
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.	N’ihi ya, ọ bụ otu n’ime ihe ndị bụ́ isi mere anyị ji wuo dike a.		0.00	0.00	16.00
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.	Obi dị gị ụtọ na ị matara Onye Na-ekiri Ihe.		0.00	0.00	10.00
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.	Ọ na-eme ka obi sie anyị ike na ihe LHC ga-ahụ.		0.00	0.00	11.00
There are many other things.	E nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ.		0.00	0.00	6.00
There's another issue, which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually -- seem, as you go back in time, they seem to change in strength.	E nwere ihe ọzọ na-esere unu okwu, bụ́ nke bụ na ikike ndị dị n’okike ndị mara mma, ndị yiri ka hà na-adị nnọọ mma, ka unu na-alaghachi azụ n’oge, o yiri ka hà na-agbanwe n’ike.		0.00	0.00	36.00
Well, they do change in strength.	Ha na-eme mgbanwe n’ike.		0.00	0.00	4.00
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together, gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.	Ya mere, ike nchebe, ikike nke na-ejikọta anyị ọnụ, na-esikwu ike ka ị na-aga n’ebe ndị ka elu.		0.00	0.00	18.00
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together, gets weaker.	Ike dị ike, ikike nuklia siri ike, bụ́ nke na-eme ka nuklii dịkwuo ike.		0.00	0.00	14.00
It's almost as if there was one beautiful kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.	Ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na e nwere otu ụdị ike na-enye nkwado, laghachi ná mmalite nke oge.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Now there's a theory called super-symmetry, which doubles the number of particles in the standard model, which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.	Ugbu a, echiche a na-akpọ usoro ndị na-enye nkwado, bụ́ nke na-eme ka ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị na-ekerịta òkè n’ihe nlereanya, bụ́ ndị, ná mmalite, onye na-ahụ ụzọ, na-adị ka ebe dị mfe.		0.00	0.00	32.00
But actually, with this theory, we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy.	Ma n’ezie, n’ihi nkwenkwe a, anyị na-achọpụta na o yiri ka ikike ndị e kere eke hà na-adị n’otu, laghachi azụ n’amụma Big-masịrị nnọọ mma.		0.00	0.00	25.00
Also, those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter.	Tụkwasị na nke ahụ, isiokwu ndị ahụ na-enye nkwado na-esi nnọọ ike maka okwu ahụ gbara ọchịchịrị.		0.00	0.00	17.00
So a very compelling theory that's really mainstream physics.	N’ihi ya, e nwere ọtụtụ ihe ndị na-eme ka mmadụ ghara ịna-eche echiche nke ọma.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC.	Ọ bụrụkwa na m ga-etinye ego na ya, m ga-etinye ego m ga-eji na-arụ ọrụ na nkà mmụta sayensị nke na ihe ndị a ga-agbasa na LHC.		0.00	0.00	27.00
Many other things that the LHC could discover.	Ọtụtụ ihe ndị ọzọ LHC pụrụ ịchọta.		0.00	0.00	7.00
But in the last few minutes, I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.	Ma n’ime minit ole na ole gara aga, achọrọ m nnọọ inye gị echiche dịgasị iche banyere ihe ndị m na-eche banyere ahụ́ ike pụtara n’ezie nye m ọgwụ na nkà mmụta ahụ́.		0.00	0.00	33.00
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story, if you'd like -- about the universe, from modern science over the last few decades.	Ọ na-emekwa ka m chee na ihe ndị m na-eche banyere ha na-enye anyị akụkọ magburu onwe ya banyere ihe ndị e kere eke, ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-eche banyere eluigwe na ala, malite n’ihe karịrị afọ iri na ole gara aga.		0.00	0.00	43.00
And I'd say that it deserves, in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk, to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.	Iod na-ekwukwa na o kwesịrị ekwesị, n’ime mmụọ nke Wade Davis, ịnagide ma ọ dịghị ihe ọzọ n’akụkọ ndị a magburu onwe ha nke ndị Andes na ebe ugwu.		0.00	0.00	29.00
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.	Nke a bụ akụkọ e kere eke, echere m na ọ bụ ihe magburu onwe ya.                                                  		0.00	0.00	65.00
It began to expand about a million, billion, billion, billion billionth of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.	Ọ malitere ịmụba ihe dị ka otu nde, ijeri, ijeri, ijeri ijeri, ijeri ijeri nke otu ijeri mmadụ nke abụọ chere na m ghọtara na mgbe Big Bang gasịrị.		0.00	0.00	29.00
Gravity separated away from the other forces.	Ọmịiko kewapụrụ ndị agha ndị ọzọ.		0.00	0.00	6.00
The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation.	Mgbe ahụ, eluigwe na ala nwetara ihe dị oké ọnụ ahịa a na-akpọ ntiwapụ.		0.00	0.00	14.00
In about the first billionth of a second or so, the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass.	N’ihe dị ka ijeri nke abụọ ma ọ bụ nke mbụ ya, ndị Higgs kụrụ akụ, ụlọ ọrụ na ihe nkiri ndị na-eme ka anyị bilie.		0.00	0.00	26.00

After about a few minutes, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe.	Mgbe ihe dị ka minit ole na ole gasịrị, e nwere hydrogen na hel n’eluigwe na ala.		0.00	0.00	17.00
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium.	Eluigwe na ala dị ihe dị ka pasent 75 nke hydrogen, pasent 25 nke hydrogen.		0.00	0.00	15.00
It continued to expand about 300 million years.	Ọ nọgidere na-amụba ihe dị ka nde afọ 300.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Then light began to travel through the universe.	E mesịa, ìhè malitere ịgbaga eluigwe na ala.		0.00	0.00	8.00
It was big enough to be transparent to light, and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God.

After about 400 million years, the first stars formed, and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook into the heavier elements.	Mgbe ihe dị ka narị afọ anọ gasịrị, kpakpando mbụ ahụ malitere, hydrogen ahụ, bụ́ hydrogen, maliteziri ịbanye n’ihe ndị ka ukwuu.		0.00	0.00	22.00
So the elements of life -- carbon, and oxygen and iron, all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars, which then ran out of fuel, exploded, threw those elements back into the universe.

And on some of those planets, the oxygen, which had been created in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen to form water, liquid water on the surface.

On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets, primitive life evolved, which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania, and eventually left a footprint on another world.

As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said, these are the things -- and actually, not only these, but I was looking around -- these are the things, like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik, and DNA, and literature and science -- these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years.

It makes me really feel that that civilization -- which, as I say, if you believe the scientific creation story, has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics, and a few hydrogen atoms -- then I think, to me anyway, it makes me feel incredibly valuable.

So, I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time.	N’ihi ya, eji m afọ iri sochirinụ na-agụ banyere ìgwè mmadụ n’oge m na-anọghị n’ozi.		0.00	0.00	15.00
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.	Ma otu n’ime ihe ndị mere m ji chọta mmasị a bụ na amalitere m ịhụ na anyị maara nnọọ ụdị ndụ nile dị na mbara ala n’ihi mbara ala nke mmadụ bi, o yikwara ka ọ dịghị onye na-ege ntị n’ụdị nile dị ndụ n’ezie bụ́ ndị na-adịru ndụ.		0.00	0.00	50.00
And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.	Isiokwu ya na-ekwukwa kpọmkwem banyere ụdị dị iche iche nke usoro nthropic, bụ́ ndị meworo ka echiche ụmụ mmadụ kakwuo njọ, ụdị dị iche iche dị ka ratro na kokroakrok na ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	33.00
And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.	Ka m na-elekwa ha anya, achọpụtara m na ha nwere ihe ha na-ekiri.		0.00	0.00	13.00
They'd become extremely adept at living with us.	Ahụhụ na-aghọ ihe a na-anakwere nke ukwuu ná ndụ anyị.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.	Mgbe anyị laghachiri, anyị gbalịrị nnọọ igbu ha n’oge nile.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.	Mgbe anyị na-eme otú ahụ, anyị nọ na-etinye ha n’ihe ize ndụ.		0.00	0.00	12.00
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.	Anyị nọ na-enye ha ụdị ihe nile mere anyị ga-eji nakwere ụzọ ọhụrụ.		0.00	0.00	13.00
So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.	Dị ka ihe atụ, e nwere ike ikwu na ọ bụ ndị na-ekesa ihe na-adịghị mma.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.	Ọkockroakes, dị ka onye ọ bụla nke na-agbalị ịchụpụ ha maara, aghọwo n’ezie ndị na-ede uri bụ́ ndị na-adịghị eji ha eme ihe.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.	N’ihi ya, echere m na ka m na-arụ ihe ndị na-abachaghị uru.		0.00	0.00	12.00
Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.	Mgbe ahụ, ka anyị na-arụ ihe anyị abụọ pụrụ irite uru na ya, hụkwa ụzọ ụfọdụ anyị ga-esi soro ụdị ndị a na-enwe mmekọrịta ọhụrụ.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And so I built the vending machine.	Ọ bụkwa otú ahụ ka m si wuo ígwè ndị ahụ.		0.00	0.00	11.00
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.	Ma akụkọ banyere ígwè e ji emepụta ihe na-adọrọ mmasị karị ma ọ bụrụ na ị matakwuo banyere ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	20.00
It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.	Ọ na-emegharị na ìgwè mmadụ na-ebuli onwe ha elu dị nnọọ ka ha na ụmụ mmadụ na-adị ndụ n’ezie.		0.00	0.00	19.00
They're found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America.	A na-ahụ Theyl n’ebe nile n’ụwa ma e wezụga Actic na n’ebe ndịda Ebe Ndịda America.		0.00	0.00	16.00
And in all that area, they're only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings.	N’ebe ahụ nile, ọ bụghị nanị na a na-ahụkarị ihe karịrị kilomita ise n’ebe ụmụ mmadụ nọ.		0.00	0.00	17.00
So we may not think about them, but they're always around.	N’ihi ya, o nwere ike anyị agaghị eche banyere ha, ma ha na-anọkarị.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.	Ọ bụghị ihe ijuanya na ọnụ ọgụgụ mmadụ na-amụba, ihe karịrị ọkara nke ndị mmadụ bi n’obodo ukwu dị ugbu a.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And out of those, nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities.	N’aka ndị ahụ, ọnụ ọgụgụ itoolu nke ndị mmadụ na-amụba na-adị n’obodo ukwu.		0.00	0.00	13.00
We're seeing a population boom with crows.	Ahụ́ na-ama jijiji na-ahụ ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	6.00
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.	N’ihi ya, nnụnụ na-egosi na anyị pụrụ ịdị na-ahụ ka anyị na-eto n’ụba ha.		0.00	0.00	14.00
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.	Ma ihe na-amasị m n’ezie bụ ịchọpụta na nnụnụ ndị ahụ na-anabata n’ụzọ dị ukwuu.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And I'll give you an example of that.	Ill na-enyekwa gị ihe atụ.		0.00	0.00	5.00
So this is Betty.	N’ihi ya, nke a bụ Betty.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood.	Ìgwè mmadụ ndị a na-ejikwa osisi ndị dị n’ime ọhịa eme ihe iji nweta ụmụ ahụhụ ma ghara isi n’osisi pụta.		0.00	0.00	21.00
Here, she's trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube.	N’ebe a, a na-agbalịsi ike inweta anụ n’úkwù.		0.00	0.00	8.00
But the researchers had a problem.	Ma ndị nchọpụta ahụ nwere nsogbu.		0.00	0.00	6.00
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.	Ha na-ekwusara ha ozi ọma ma hapụ ha ka ha gaa ebe ahụ.		0.00	0.00	13.00
And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.	O nwekwara ohere ọ ga-eji mee nke a.		0.00	0.00	8.00
You see, it wasn't working very well.	Ị na-ahụ, ọ na-atọ gị ụtọ ịrụ ọrụ nke ọma.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Now this is completely unprompted.	Ugbu a, a pụghị ịkpali nke a kpam kpam.		0.00	0.00	9.00
No one taught her to bend this into a hook, had shown her how it could happen.	Ọ dịghị onye kụziiri ya ka o jiri akwụkwọ a mee ihe, gosiri ya otú ọ pụrụ isi mee ya.		0.00	0.00	20.00
But she did it all on her own.	Ma o mere ihe nile n’onwe ya.		0.00	0.00	7.00
So keep in mind that she's never seen this done.	N’ihi ya, cheta na ọ dịtụghị mgbe ihe a mere.		0.00	0.00	10.00
Their brains are proportionate, in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are.	Ụgbọ ha na-adọrọ mmasị, n’otu akụkụ ahụ, dị ka mmiri ozuzo na-acha uhie uhie.		0.00	0.00	14.00
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have.	E nwere ụdị ọgụgụ isi dị iche iche ha nwere.		0.00	0.00	10.00
For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.	Dị ka ihe atụ, na Sweden, ìgwè mmadụ ga-echere ndị ọkụ azụ̀ ka ha na-agafe agafe n’                            		0.00	0.00	44.00
And when the fishermen move off, the crows fly down, reel up the lines, and eat the fish or the bait.	Mgbe ndị ọkụ azụ̀ na-agafekwa, ìgwè mmadụ ahụ na-agbada, na-ebupụ ahịhịa ndị ahụ, ma rie azụ̀ ma ọ bụ bred.		0.00	0.00	20.00
It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.	Ọ na-eme ka ndị ọkụ azụ̀ mara mma.		0.00	0.00	8.00
On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.	N’ime njem dị nnọọ iche, na Mahadum Washington, ha nọ na-eme ihe ruo afọ ole na ole gara aga, bụ́ ebe ha dọọrọ ìgwè mmadụ n’ogige ịta ahụhụ.		0.00	0.00	28.00
Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.	Ụfọdụ ụmụ akwụkwọ na-apụ ma kesaa ìgwè mmadụ ụfọdụ, wetaara ha, a na-enyekwa ha nsogbu, ma na-eti ha ihe ma na-akparị ha, ma hapụ ha ọzọ.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.	A na-achọkwa ịchọpụta na ruo n’izu ndị ọzọ, ìgwè mmadụ ndị a, mgbe ọ bụla ụmụ akwụkwọ ndị a na-ejegharị n’ogige ahụ, ìgwè mmadụ ndị a ga-atụba ha, ma gbaa ọsọ ma mee ka ndụ ha bụrụ ihe na-adịghị mma.		0.00	0.00	40.00
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week.	Ha enweghị ihe ha ga-eme mgbe nke a gara n’ihu n’izu na-esonụ.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And the next month.	Ọnwa sochirinụ.		0.00	0.00	2.00
Until they finally graduated and left campus, and -- glad to get away, I'm sure -- came back sometime later, and found the crows still remembered them.	Ruo mgbe ha gụsịrị akwụkwọ ma hapụ kampọs, na-enwekwa obi ụtọ ịpụ, Im na-alọta mgbe ụfọdụ, ma chọta ìgwè mmadụ ka na-echeta ha.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So -- the moral being, don't piss off crows.	N’ihi ya, ọ bụrụ na mmadụ na-eme omume ọma, ọ ga-eme ka ìgwè mmadụ na-akpafu.		0.00	0.00	15.00
So now, students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask.	Ya mere, ugbu a, ụmụ akwụkwọ nọ na Mahadum Washington bụ́ ndị na-amụ ìgwè mmadụ ndị a na-amụrụ otu nwa atụrụ na nnukwu ígwè ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	25.00
So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.	N’ihi ya, anyị maara na ìgwè mmadụ ndị a na-ama nnọọ mma, ma ka m na-amụtakwu nke a, otú ahụ ka m na-achọpụtakwu na ha nwere ọbụna ohere dị ịrịba ama karị.		0.00	0.00	32.00
The problem now is collecting the bits, without getting run over.	Nsogbu a na-enwe ugbu a na-achịkọta ihe ndị ahụ, n’egbughị oge.		0.00	0.00	11.00
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.	Chere ka ìhè ahụ kwụsị ụgbọ okporo ígwè ahụ.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.	E mesịa, chịkọtazie ihe ndị ị na-eme ná nchebe.		0.00	0.00	9.00
So what's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars to crack nuts.	Ya mere, ihe ndị dị ịrịba ama banyere àgwàetiti a bụ́ ndị ìgwè mmadụ na-eji ụgbọala eme ihe iji nweta nọmba.		0.00	0.00	21.00
In fact, that's old hat for crows.	N’ezie, akpịrị na-akpọ ìgwè mmadụ asị n’oge ochie.		0.00	0.00	8.00
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo.	Nke a mere ihe dị ka afọ 10 gara aga n’otu ebe a na-akpọ Sendai City, n’ụlọ akwụkwọ na-akwọ ụgbọala na Tokyo.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And since that time, all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior.	Kemgbe ahụ, ìgwè mmadụ nile nọ n’ógbè ahụ na-ebuli àgwà a elu.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And now, every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk, waiting to collect its lunch.	Ugbu a kwa, oghere ọ bụla dị n’ime kilogram ise na-eguzo n’akụkụ ya, na-echere ịchịkọta akpa ume ya.		0.00	0.00	18.00
So, they're learning from each other.	N’ihi ya, ha na-amụta ihe n’aka ibe ha.		0.00	0.00	8.00
Parents seem to be teaching their young.	O yiri ka ndị nne na nna hà na-akụziri ụmụ ha ihe.		0.00	0.00	12.00
They've learned from their peers.	Ndị ọgbọ ha amụtala ihe.		0.00	0.00	5.00
If I have a little extra time, I'll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely.	Ọ bụrụ na m nwere obere oge, Irell na-agwa gị banyere ihe ndị na-egosi na ọ bụ eziokwu.		0.00	0.00	18.00
The point being that they've developed cultural adaptation.	Isi ihe na-egosi na ha emewo ka ọdịnala dị iche iche malite.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And as we heard yesterday, that's the Pandora's box that's getting human beings in trouble, and we're starting to see it with them.	Dị ka anyị na-anụ n’ehihie, ndị na-eti mkpu maka igbe ndị Pandoraz na-eme ka ụmụ mmadụ na-enwe nsogbu, ọ na-agụsikwa ha agụụ ike ịhụ ya.		0.00	0.00	25.00
They're able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment, which is really useful if you live in a city.	Ahụ́ na-eru ha ala ngwa ngwa, ma eleghị anya, na-anakwere ihe ịma aka ndị ọhụrụ na ihe ndị ọhụrụ n’ebe ha bi, bụ́ ndị bara uru n’ezie ma ọ bụrụ na i bi n’obodo.		0.00	0.00	34.00
So we know that there's lots of crows.	N’ihi ya, anyị maara na e nwere ọtụtụ ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	10.00
We found out they're really smart, and we found out that they can teach each other.	Anyị chọpụtara na ha bụ ezigbo mmadụ, anyị chọpụtakwara na ha nwere ike ịkụziri ibe ha ihe.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And when all this became clear to me, I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.	Mgbe ihe a nile bịara doo m anya, achọpụtara m nanị ihe doro anya m ga-eme bụ ịrụzi ígwè e ji eme ihe.		0.00	0.00	23.00
This is a vending machine for crows.	Nke a bụ ihe oriri nye ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages.	Ọ na-ejikwa ọzụzụ Skinnerian eme ka àgwà ha ka mma n’ihe karịrị akụkụ anọ.		0.00	0.00	14.00
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field, or someplace where there's lots of crows, and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine.	N’ụzọ bụ́ isi, ihe na-eme bụ na anyị na-etinye nke a n’ubi, ma ọ bụ n’ebe ụfọdụ, ìgwè mmadụ, anyị na-etinyekwa mkpụrụ ego na ahụekere n’akụkụ nile nke maine.              		0.00	0.00	42.00
And crows eventually come by, and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there.	Ìgwè mmadụ na-emesịkwa bịa, rie ahụekere ndị ahụ ma jiri ha mee ihe n’ebe ahụ.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And eventually, they eat up all the peanuts.	N’ikpeazụ, ha na-eri ahụekere nile.		0.00	0.00	5.00
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray, and they hop up and help themselves.	Ha na-ahụkwa na e nwere ahụekere n’ebe a n’ụgbọ okporo ígwè, ha na-ebili ma na-enyere onwe ha aka.		0.00	0.00	18.00
And then they leave, and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts, and life is really dandy, if you're a crow.	E mesịa, ha na-ahapụ, ígwè ọrụ na-ebelatakwu mkpụrụ ego na ahụekere, ndụ bụkwa n’ezie ihe mgbochi, ma ọ bụrụ na ị bụ onye na-eto eto.		0.00	0.00	25.00
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut.	Mgbe ahụ, ị pụrụ ịlaghachi azụ n’oge ọ bụla ma mee onwe gị ahụekere.		0.00	0.00	14.00
So, when they get really used to that, we move on to the crows coming back.	Ya mere, mgbe e ji ha mee ihe n’ezie, anyị na-agakwuru ìgwè mmadụ ahụ na-alọta.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Now, they're used to the sound of the machine, and they keep coming back, and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that's there.	Ugbu a, a na-eji ígwè ọrụ ahụ eme ihe, ha anọgidekwa na-alọta, na-ebupụtakwa ahịhịa ndị a site n’otu akụkụ mkpụrụ ego ndị dị n’ebe ahụ.		0.00	0.00	25.00
And when they get really happy about this, we go ahead and stymie them.	Mgbe ha nwetakwara obi ụtọ n’ezie banyere nke a, anyị na-aga n’ihu ma na-eme ka ha yie.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And we move to the third stage, where we only give them a coin.	Anyị na-akwaga n’okporo ụzọ nke atọ, bụ́ ebe anyị na-enye ha mkpụrụ ego.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Now, like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing, this really pisses them off.	Ugbu a, dị ka ihe ka ọtụtụ n’ime anyị bụ́ ndị chefuworo n’ụzọ dị mma, nke a na-eme ka ha pụọ n’ezie.		0.00	0.00	22.00
So, they do what they do in nature when they're looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak.	N’ihi ya, ha na-eme ihe ha na-eme mgbe ha na-achọ ihe ndị na-egbochi ha ime.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And they do that here, and that knocks the coins down the slot, and when that happens, they get a peanut.	Ha na-emekwa nke ahụ n’ebe a, nke ahụ na-akụ mkpụrụ ego ndị ahụ n’úkwù, mgbe nke ahụ mere, ha na-enweta ahụekere.		0.00	0.00	21.00
And so this goes on for some time.	Nke a na-agakwa n’ihu ruo oge ụfọdụ.		0.00	0.00	7.00
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up, wait for the coin to come out, put the coin in the slot, and then they get their peanut.	Ìgwè mmadụ ahụ na-amụta na ihe nile ha na-aghaghị ime bụ igosipụta, na-echere ka mkpụrụ ego ahụ pụta, tinye mkpụrụ ego ahụ n’úkwù, mgbe ahụekere ha.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And when they're really good and comfortable with that, we move to the final stage, in which they show up and nothing happens.	Mgbe ha na-eme nke ọma ma na-akasi anyị obi, anyị na-akwaga n’ebe ikpeazụ, bụ́ ebe ha na-egosi na ọ dịghị ihe na-eme.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals.	Nke a bụkwa ebe anyị na-ahụ ọdịiche dị n’etiti ìgwè mmadụ na anụmanụ ndị ọzọ.		0.00	0.00	15.00
Squirrels, for example, would show up, look for the peanut, go away.	Dị ka ihe atụ, ihe ndị na-akpali agụụ mmekọahụ ga-apụta, na-achọ ahụekere, na-apụ.		0.00	0.00	13.00
Come back, look for the peanut, go away.	Laghachi azụ, chọọ ahụekere, pụọ.		0.00	0.00	5.00
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored, and then they go off and play in traffic.	Ha na-eme nke a ikekwe ọkara ugboro ole na ole tupu ha adaa, mgbe ahụkwa ha na-aga ma na-egwuri egwu.                                        		0.00	0.00	59.00
Crows, on the other hand, show up, and they try and figure it out.	N’aka nke ọzọ, ha na-eguzo ọtọ, na-agbalịkwa ma nọchie ya.		0.00	0.00	10.00
They know that this machine's been messing with them, through three different stages of behavior.	Ha maara na ndị isi ọrụ a na-ekwusara ha ozi ọma, site n’àgwà atọ dịgasị iche.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So, they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot.	N’ihi ya, ha na-ese ya ma na-ele ya anya dị ka ihe na-adịghị mma.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that, "Hey, there's lots of coins lying around from the first stage, lying around on the ground," hops down, picks it up, drops it in the slot.	N’ikpeazụ, ụfọdụ ndị na-akụ azụ̀ na-ekwu na, na-echekwa na, bụ́ Hey Hey, si otú ahụ nweta mkpụrụ ego ndị dị gburugburu, na-ebi gburugburu ala, na-ele anya n’ala, na-ebuli ya elu, na-ebuli ya elu, na-ebuli ya elu n’@@		0.00	0.00	37.00
And then, we're off to the races.	Mgbe ahụ, esemokwu na-ebelata agbụrụ ndị ahụ.		0.00	0.00	7.00
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts, until his friends figure out how to do it, and then there we go.	Nke ahụ na-atọ anyị ụtọ kwa ọnwa n’ọnwa, ruo mgbe ndị enyi ya matara otú anyị ga-esi na-eme ya, anyị na-agakwa ebe ahụ.		0.00	0.00	23.00
So, what's significant about this to me isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.	Ya mere, ihe ndị dị ịrịba ama banyere nke a na-egosi na anyị pụrụ ịzụ ìgwè mmadụ iji zụọ ahụekere.		0.00	0.00	20.00
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year, but I'm not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows.	N’uche gị, e nwere ihe dị ka nde dollar 216 bụ́ ndị kwesịrị ịgbanwe kwa afọ, ma o doro m anya na m pụrụ ịdabere na ROI site n’ìgwè mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	30.00
Instead, I think we should look a little bit larger.	Kama nke ahụ, echere m na anyị kwesịrị ilekwasị anya n’ihe ka ukwuu.		0.00	0.00	13.00

I want to say why psychology was good, why it was not good and how it may become, in the next 10 years, good enough.	Achọrọ m ikwu ihe mere nkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà ji dị mma, n’ihi gịnị ka o ji bụrụ ihe na-adịghị mma na otú ọ pụrụ isi ghọọ, n’ime afọ 10 sochirinụ, dị mma.		0.00	0.00	33.00

And because, quite rightly, they were saying psychology is about finding what's wrong with you.	Ebe ọ bụkwa na, n’ụzọ ziri ezi, ha nọ na-ekwu banyere akparamàgwà mmadụ na-achọ ịchọta ihe na-ezighị ezi n’ebe ị nọ.		0.00	0.00	21.00

And what was good about psychology, about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made, about working in the disease model, about what you mean by psychology, is that, 60 years ago, none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors.	Ihe dịkwa mma banyere nkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà mmadụ, ihe dị ka ijeri mmadụ 30 na-achụ nta ego NIMH mere, banyere ịrụ ọrụ n’ihe nlereanya nke ọrịa, banyere ihe ị pụtara site n’akparamàgwà mmadụ, bụ na, afọ 60 gara aga, ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n’ime ihe ndị na-akpata nsogbu ahụ bụ ise siga na enyo.		0.00	0.00	56.00

And the other thing that happened is that a science developed, a science of mental illness.	Ihe ọzọ merenụ bụ na ọkà mmụta sayensị malitere, bụ́ ọkà mmụta sayensị nke ọrịa uche.		0.00	0.00	16.00
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression, alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor.	Anyị chọpụtara na o nwere ike iju anyị anya na anyị nwere ike ịda mbà n’obi, na-aṅụbiga mmanya ókè ma na-eme ka ha na-enwe obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	26.00

That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses.	Anyị pụrụ ịghọta ihe kpatara ọrịa uche.		0.00	0.00	7.00
We could look across time at the same people -- people, for example, who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering, of genetics are, and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses.

And best of all, we were able, in the last 50 years, to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments.	Karịsịa, anyị nwere ike, n’ime afọ 50 gara aga, iji gwọọ ọgwụ ọjọọ na ọgwụgwọ ndị na-akpata ọrịa uche.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And then we were able to test them rigorously, in random assignment, placebo controlled designs, throw out the things that didn't work, keep the things that actively did.	Mgbe ahụ, anyị nwara ha n’ụzọ dị ukwuu, n’ikenye ha ọrụ, n’ọnọdụ ndị a na-achịkwa achịkwa, na-atụfu ihe ndị na-enweghị isi, na-edebe ihe ndị na-arụsi ọrụ ike.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry, over the last 60 years, can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable.	Nkwubi okwu ahụ bụkwa na nkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà mmadụ na ọrịa uche, n’ihe karịrị afọ 60 gara aga, pụrụ ikwu n’ezie na anyị pụrụ ime ka ndị na-enweghị ike imehie ihe.		0.00	0.00	32.00
And I think that's terrific.	M na-echekwa na ọ na-eme ka ihe na-esiri m ike.		0.00	0.00	10.00
But what was not good, the consequences of that were three things.	Ma, ihe atọ ga-esi na ya pụta bụ ihe atọ.		0.00	0.00	10.00
The first was moral, that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers, that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you.	Nke mbụ bụ omume, na ndị ọkà n’akparamàgwà mmadụ na ndị na-agwọ ọrịa ghọrọ ndị ọkà n’akparamàgwà mmadụ, ndị ọkà n’akparamàgwà mmadụ, na echiche anyị banyere ọdịdị mmadụ bụ na ọ bụrụ na ị nọ ná nsogbu, broshuọ dakwasịrị gị.                     		0.00	0.00	60.00
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.	Anyị chefukwara na ndị mmadụ mere nhọrọ na mkpebi.		0.00	0.00	9.00
We forgot responsibility.	Anyị chefuru ibu ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	4.00
The second cost was that we forgot about you people.	Ihe nke abụọ ọ ga-efu bụ na anyị chefuru banyere gị ndị mmadụ.                                                                    		0.00	0.00	80.00
We forgot about improving normal lives.	Anyị chefuru banyere ime ka ndụ ka mma.		0.00	0.00	8.00
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more productive.	Anyị chefuru ọrụ nke ime ka ndị na-enweghị nsogbu na-enwe obi ụtọ, na-arụpụtakwu ihe.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier, positive interventions.	Nsogbu nke atọ anyị nwere banyere ọrịa ahụ bụ, ná mkpali anyị ime ihe banyere ndị nọ ná nsogbu, ná mkpali anyị ime ihe banyere imezi ihe banyere imezi ihe, ọ dịtụghị mgbe ọ ga-eme ka anyị nwee ike ime ihe iji mee ka ndị mmadụ na-enwe obi ụtọ, na-eme ka ndị mmadụ na-eme ihe ndị dị mma.		0.00	0.00	58.00
And so, that's what led people like Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology, which has three aims.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dịkwa, ihe dugara ndị dị ka Nancy Etcoff, Dan Gilbert, Mike Csikszenthalie ma na-arụ ọrụ n’ihe m na-akpọ nkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà mmadụ atọ, bụ́ nke nwere mmeri atọ.		0.00	0.00	33.00
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness.	Nke mbụ bụ na nkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà kwesịrị ịdị nnọọ ka ọ na-eche banyere ike mmadụ dị ka ọ dị n’adịghị ike.		0.00	0.00	23.00
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage.	O kwesịrị ịdị nnọọ ka ọ na-eche banyere iwuli elu dị ka ihe na-emebi ihe.		0.00	0.00	15.00
It should be interested in the best things in life.	O kwesịrị inwe mmasị n’ihe ndị kasị mma ná ndụ.		0.00	0.00	10.00
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling, and with genius, with nurturing high talent.	O kwesịkwara ịdị nnọọ ka ọ na-echegbu onwe ya ime ka ndụ ndị mmadụ na-emezukwa, na-enwekwa nkà dị elu.		0.00	0.00	19.00
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future, we've seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology, a science of what makes life worth living.	N’ihi ya, n’afọ iri gara aga na olileanya e nwere maka ọdịnihu, ndị na-adịghị ahụ mmalite nke nkà mmụta ihe ndị dị mma, bụ́ ọkà mmụta sayensị nke ihe na-eme ka ndụ dị mma.		0.00	0.00	34.00
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness.	Ọ na-eme ka anyị ghọta ụdị obi ụtọ dị iche iche.		0.00	0.00	11.00
And any of you, for free, can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness.	Onye ọ bụla n’ime unu nwekwara ike ịga n’ebe a na-edebe ihe n’Ịntanet ma were ule niile nke obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	20.00
You can ask, how do you stack up for positive emotion, for meaning, for flow, against literally tens of thousands of other people?	Ị pụrụ ịjụ, sị, Olee otú i si akwụsịlata inwe mmetụta dị mma, maka nzube, maka ime njem, megide ọtụtụ puku mmadụ ndị ọzọ n’ụzọ nkịtị?		0.00	0.00	26.00
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states, the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness.

I've spent my life working on extremely miserable people, and I've asked the question, how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you?	Ọ̀ dịla mgbe m ji ndụ m na-arụ ọrụ ná ndụ ndị na-enweghị isi, Iya ajụọkwa ajụjụ ahụ, olee otú ndị na-enweghị ike isi dị iche n’ebe ndị ọzọ nọ?		0.00	0.00	30.00

And how do they differ from the rest of us?	Oleekwa otú ha si dị iche n’ebe ndị ọzọ nọ?		0.00	0.00	10.00

And we find that we've been able to manualize many of them, and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies.	Anyị na-achọpụtakwa na anyị enwebeghị ike iji ọtụtụ n’ime ha na-eme ihe, anyị na-enwekwa ike ịrụ ọrụ ndị e nyere anyị, na-amụkwa ihe ndị dị irè.		0.00	0.00	26.00
That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?	Nke ahụ bụ, olee ndị na-eme ka ndị mmadụ nwekwuo obi ụtọ?		0.00	0.00	12.00
In a couple of minutes, I'll tell you about some of those results.	N’ime minit ole na ole, Irell gwara gị banyere ụfọdụ n’ime ihe ndị ahụ ga-esi na ya pụta.		0.00	0.00	18.00
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have, in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill, and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable, is can psychology actually make people happier?	Ma mgbawa nke a bụ na ọrụ m chọrọ ka ndị mmadụ na-arịa ọrịa, tinyekwara n’ọrụ nke ịgwọ ọrịa uche, nakwa site n’ịrụ ọrụ nke ime ka ndị na-enweghị ike ịrụ ọrụ, ọ̀ pụrụ ime ka ndị mmadụ nwekwuo obi ụtọ n’ezie?		0.00	0.00	42.00
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we've had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy.	Iji jụọ ajụjụ ahụ, ọ bụghị okwu m na-eji eme ihe n’ụzọ na-adịghị mma na-eme ka ọ daa mbà n’ihe m na-eche na obi ụtọ dị ukwuu.		0.00	0.00	27.00
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them, it's possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives.	Ekwekwara m na e nwere ụzọ atọ dị iche iche mụ na ha na-akpọku ha n’ihi na ihe dị iche na-ewuli ha elu, ọ ga-ekwe omume inwe otu onye kama inwe ndụ obi ụtọ ndị ọzọ nwere.		0.00	0.00	37.00
The first happy life is the pleasant life.	Ndụ nke mbụ bụ ndụ obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	7.00
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can, and the skills to amplify it.	Nke a bụ ndụ ị na-enwe mmetụta dị mma ka i nwere ike inwe, nkà ndị i nwere iji kwado ya.		0.00	0.00	21.00
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work, your parenting, your love, your leisure, time stops for you.	Nke abụọ bụ ndụ ị na-ebi n’ọrụ gị, nne ma ọ bụ nna gị, ịhụnanya gị, ntụrụndụ gị, oge gị na-akwụsị.		0.00	0.00	21.00
That's what Aristotle was talking about.	Ọ bụ ihe Aristotle na-ekwu banyere ya.		0.00	0.00	7.00
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them.	Ya mere, achọrọ m ikwu obere ihe banyere onye ọ bụla n’ime ndị ahụ na ihe anyị maara banyere ha.		0.00	0.00	20.00
The first life is the pleasant life and it's simply, as best we can find it, it's having as many of the pleasures as you can, as much positive emotion as you can, and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them, that stretch them over time and space.	Ndụ mbụ bụ ndụ obi ụtọ na ihe ndị dị mma, dị nnọọ ka ọ kasị mma anyị pụrụ ịchọta ya, ihe ndị na-eme ka mmadụ nwee ọtụtụ ihe ụtọ dị ka i nwere ike, dị nnọọ ka i nwere ike, na ịmụta nkà ndị na-eme ka ha na-adị ná mma, na-eme ka ha na-enwe obi ụtọ, na-emekwa ka ha na-enwe obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	63.00
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks, and it's why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn't end here.	Ma ndụ na-enye obi ụtọ nwere ihe nkiri atọ, ọ bụkwa ya mere o ji dị mma ka mmadụ ghara inwe obi ụtọ na ihe mere o ji kwụsị ebe a.		0.00	0.00	31.00
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life, your experience of positive emotion, is heritable, about 50 percent heritable, and, in fact, not very modifiable.	Nke mbụ bụ na ọ na-eme ka ndụ gị dị ụtọ, otú obi dị gị, bụ ihe nketa, ihe dị ka pasent 50 pụrụ ịdabere na ya, ọ bụghịkwa nke a pụrụ ịtụkwasị obi.		0.00	0.00	34.00
So the different tricks that Matthieu [Ricard] and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.	Ya mere, ihe ndị dị iche iche Matthieu [ Ricard ] na ndị ọzọ maara banyere ịmụba mmetụta ndị dị mma ná ndụ gị bụ pasent 15 ruo 20, inwetakwu ya.		0.00	0.00	31.00
Second is that positive emotion habituates.	Nke abụọ bụ na mmetụta dị mma na-eme ka mmadụ                                                                          		0.00	0.00	83.00
It's all like French vanilla ice cream, the first taste is a 100 percent; by the time you're down to the sixth taste, it's gone.	Osisi ndị dị ka vanla French vanla, mpempe akwụkwọ nke mbụ bụ pasent 100 ; ka ọ na-erule mgbe ị na-erule n’obosara nke isii, ọ na-agafe.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And, as I said, it's not particularly malleable.	Dị ka m kwuru, ọ dịghị njọ karịsịa.		0.00	0.00	8.00
And this leads to the second life.	Nke a na-edugakwa ná ndụ nke abụọ.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And I have to tell you about my friend, Len, to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion, more than building pleasure.	Aghaghị m ịgwa gị banyere enyi m, bụ́ Len, ikwu banyere ihe mere o ji dị mma ka mmadụ nwee obi ụtọ karịa inwe obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	26.00
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30, Len was enormously successful.	N’oge Len dị afọ 30, Len nwere nnọọ ihe ịga nke ọma.		0.00	0.00	12.00
By the time he was 20, he was an options trader.	Ka ọ na-erule mgbe ọ dị afọ 20, ọ bụ onye na-arụ ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	13.00
By the time he was 25, he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company.	Ka ọ na-erule mgbe ọ dị afọ 25, ọ bụ otu ijeri mmadụ na onyeisi ụlọ ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Second, in play -- he's a national champion bridge player.	Nke abụọ bụ na onye na-egwu egwuregwu na-eji ígwè ọrụ ndị na-eme egwuregwu mba ahụ eme egwuregwu.		0.00	0.00	17.00
But in the third great arena of life, love, Len is an abysmal failure.	Ma na nke atọ nke ndụ, ịhụnanya, Len bụ ihe na-enweghị isi.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And the reason he was, was that Len is a cold fish.	Ihe kpatara ya bụ na Len bụ azụ̀ oyi.		0.00	0.00	9.00
American women said to Len, when he dated them, "You're no fun.	Ndị inyom bụ́ ndị America gwara Len, mgbe ọ na-eyi ha egwu, bụ́ ndị Youy na-eti mkpu.		0.00	0.00	17.00
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst, who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.	Len bakwara ọgaranya ruo n’ókè nke inwe ike inweta otu Ụlọ Ọrụ Na-ahụ Maka Mgbanwe nke Park, bụ́ onye gbalịrị ịchọta ụdị mmekọahụ ahụ bụ́ nke nweworo mmetụta dị mma n’ime ya.		0.00	0.00	32.00
But it turned out there wasn't any sexual trauma.	Ma, ọ bụ n’ebe ahụ ka a na-enwe mmekọahụ ọ bụla.		0.00	0.00	11.00
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football, and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities.	O mesịrị ghọọ onye Len ahụ tolitere na Long Island ma kirie foto ma kirie foto, ma kirie bridge-Len na pasent ise nke ihe anyị na-akpọ ememe ndị dị mma.		0.00	0.00	30.00
The question is, is Len unhappy?	Ajụjụ bụ, Ọ̀ bụ na Len enweghị obi ụtọ?		0.00	0.00	9.00
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity, I think Len is one of the happiest people I know.	N’ụzọ dị iche n’ihe ndị ọkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà na-agwa anyị banyere pasent 50 nke agbụrụ mmadụ nwere mmetụta dị mma, echere m na Len bụ otu n’ime ndị kasị nwee obi ụtọ m maara.		0.00	0.00	35.00
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that's because Len, like most of you, is enormously capable of flow.	A machibidoghị hel nke enweghị obi ụtọ na nke ndị ohi n’ihi na Len, dị ka ihe ka ọtụtụ n’ime unu, nwere nnọọ ike ịgbapụ.		0.00	0.00	25.00
When the first card is played, until 10 days later, the tournament is over, time stops for Len.	Mgbe e kenyere kaadị mbụ ahụ, ruo ụbọchị 10 ka e mesịrị, ụlọikwuu ahụ na-akwụsị, oge na-aga maka Len.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about, about flow.	N’ezie, nke a bụkwa ihe Mike Csiksentzenthalyi na-ekwu banyere ya, na-ekwu banyere ya.		0.00	0.00	13.00
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow, you can't feel anything.	Ma ihe Mike gwara gị mgbe ị na-eme njem ehihie, ọ dịghị ihe ị na-eche.		0.00	0.00	15.00
You're one with the music.	Egwú na-atọ gị ụtọ.                                                             		0.00	0.00	64.00
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.	Nke a bụkwa n’ezie àgwà ndị anyị na-eche banyere ha dị ka ezi ndụ.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And we think there's a recipe for it, and it's knowing what your highest strengths are.	Anyị na-echekwa echiche otú ahụ maka ya, ọ na-amakwa ihe ndị kasị ike i nwere.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And again, there's a valid test of what your five highest strengths are.	Ọzọkwa, e si otú ahụ nwalee ezigbo ule nke ihe ise kasị ike i nwere.		0.00	0.00	15.00
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can.	Mgbe ahụ, mee ka ndụ gị dị ụtọ iji ha na-eme ihe otú i nwere ike.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Re-crafting your work, your love, your play, your friendship, your parenting.	Mee ka ọrụ gị na-aga nke ọma, ịhụnanya gị, egwuregwu gị, ọbụenyi gị, nne ma ọ bụ nna gị.		0.00	0.00	19.00
Just one example.	Nanị otu ihe atụ.		0.00	0.00	4.00
She's working her way through college.	Ndị na-arụ ọrụ na mahadum.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Her highest strength was social intelligence, so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer's day.	Ike kasịnụ o nwere bụ ọgụgụ isi nke ọha na eze, n’ihi ya, ọ na-ebu oké ibu iji mee ka ọnọdụ ọha na eze ya pụta ìhè nke ụbọchị ọ bụla a na-eme omenala.		0.00	0.00	34.00
But what she did was to take her highest strengths, and re-craft work to use them as much as possible.	Ma ihe o mere iji wusie ya ike, na-arụsikwa ọrụ ike iji ha eme ihe ruo ókè o kwere mee.		0.00	0.00	20.00
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness.	Ihe ị ga-esi na nke ahụ pụta abụghị ịdị nwayọọ.		0.00	0.00	10.00
You don't look like Debbie Reynolds.	Ị na-ele anya dị ka Debbie Reynolds.		0.00	0.00	7.00
You don't giggle a lot.	Ọ na-eme ka i nwee ọtụtụ ihe ị ga-eme.		0.00	0.00	9.00
So, that's the second path.	N’ihi ya, ọ bụ ụzọ nke abụọ.		0.00	0.00	7.00
The second path is eudaimonian flow.	Ụzọ nke abụọ bụ mkpọda anyanwụ.		0.00	0.00	6.00
And the third path is meaning.	Ụzọ nke atọ nwekwara nzube.		0.00	0.00	5.00
This is the most venerable of the happinesses, traditionally.	Nke a bụ ihe kasị eme ka e nwee obi ụtọ, ọdịnala.		0.00	0.00	12.00
And meaning, in this view, consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are, and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are.	Nke a na-emekwa ka anyị mata ihe ndị kacha ike i nwere, jirikwa ha na-ejere Jehova ozi.		0.00	0.00	17.00
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives, the pleasant life, the good life, the meaningful life, people are now hard at work on the question, are there things that lastingly change those lives?	Agwara m ya na e nwere ihe atọ na-enye obi ụtọ ná ndụ, ndụ dị mma, ndụ nwere nzube, ndị mmadụ na-arụsi ọrụ ike ugbu a n’ajụjụ a, è nwere ihe ndị na-agbanwe ndụ ndị ahụ?		0.00	0.00	36.00
And the answer seems to be yes.	Azịza ya dịkwa ka ee.		0.00	0.00	5.00
It's being done in a rigorous manner.	A na-eme ya n’ụzọ dị ukwuu.		0.00	0.00	6.00
It's being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works.	A na-eme ihe n’otu ụzọ ahụ anyị si nwalee ọgwụ ọjọọ ịhụ ihe bụ́ ọrụ n’ezie.		0.00	0.00	16.00
So we do random assignment, placebo controlled, long-term studies of different interventions.	N’ihi ya, anyị na-arụ ọrụ e nyere anyị, bụ́ ebe a na-achịkwa ma na-eduzi ọmụmụ ihe dị iche iche.		0.00	0.00	19.00
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect, when we teach people about the pleasant life, how to have more pleasure in your life, one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills, the savoring skills, and you're assigned to design a beautiful day.	Ọ bụrụkwa na anyị na-akụziri ndị mmadụ banyere ndụ obi ụtọ, ọ ga-eme ka i nwee obi ụtọ ná ndụ gị, otu n’ime ọrụ ndị ị na-arụ bụ iji nkà ndị dị mkpa, nkà ndị na-eme ka mmadụ na-eme nke ọma, na otú i si arụ ọrụ ndị dị mma n’ụbọchị mara mma.		0.00	0.00	53.00
Next Saturday, set a day aside, design yourself a beautiful day, and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures.	Ọzọkwa, Saturday, wepụta otu ụbọchị, wepụta onwe gị ụbọchị mara mma, ma jiri ịdị uchu na-eme ihe iji mee ka ihe ụtọ ndị ahụ ka mma.		0.00	0.00	26.00
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced.	Anyị pụkwara igosipụta n’ụzọ dị otú ahụ na a na-eme ka ndụ dị ụtọ sikwuo ike.		0.00	0.00	16.00
Gratitude visit.	Nleta na-egosi ekele.		0.00	0.00	3.00
I'd like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction, and who you never properly thanked.	Ọ ga-amasị gị icheta onye mere ihe dị oké mkpa nke gbanwere ndụ gị n’ụzọ dị mma, ọ dịghịkwa mgbe ị kelere ya nke ọma.		0.00	0.00	25.00
The person has to be alive.	Onye ahụ aghaghị ịdị ndụ.		0.00	0.00	5.00
Now, OK, you can open your eyes.	Ugbu a, ị pụrụ imeghe anya gị.		0.00	0.00	7.00
I hope all of you have such a person.	Enwere m olileanya na i nwere ụdị onye ahụ.		0.00	0.00	9.00
Your assignment, when you're learning the gratitude visit, is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person, call them on the phone in Phoenix, ask if you can visit, don't tell them why, show up at their door, you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens.	Ọrụ ị na-arụ, mgbe ị na-amụtakwu otú ị ga-esi na-ekele ya, bụ idegara onye ahụ akwụkwọ ozi iri atọ na atọ, na-akpọ ha na fon dị na Phoenix, na-ajụ ma ị̀ pụrụ ileta ya, na-agwa ha ihe mere o ji dị mma, na-agụ ihe ndị na-agba akaebe a na-eme.		0.00	0.00	49.00
And what happens is when we test people one week later, a month later, three months later, they're both happier and less depressed.	Ihe na-emenụ bụ mgbe anyị nwara ndị mmadụ otu izu mgbe e mesịrị, otu ọnwa ka e mesịrị, ọnwa atọ ka e mesịrị, ha na-enwe obi ụtọ ma na-adakarị mbà n’obi.		0.00	0.00	31.00
Another example is a strength date, in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test, and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths, and we find this is a strengthener of relationships.	Ihe atụ ọzọ bụ oge anyị ji eme ihe, bụ́ nke anyị na-enweta di na nwunye iji mata ebe ndị kasị ike ha na-enweta n’ule, mgbe ahụkwa, iji kee otu uhuruchi nke ha abụọ ji eme ihe, anyị na-achọkwa nke a bụ ihe na-ewusikwu mmekọrịta ha ike.		0.00	0.00	47.00
But it's so heartening to be in a group like this, in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy.	Ma ọ na-enye nnọọ obi ụtọ ịnọ n’otu ìgwè dị ka nke a, bụ́ nke ọtụtụ n’ime unu meworo ka ndụ unu bụrụ nke nkà ihe ọmụma.		0.00	0.00	27.00
Well, my undergraduates and the people I work with haven't discovered this, so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun, and to contrast it.	Ọ dị mma, ndị m na-agụsị akwụkwọ na ndị m na-arụsi ọrụ ike chọtara nke a, n’ihi ya, anyị nwere n’ezie ndị mmadụ ime ihe dị mma ma na-eme ihe dị iche na ya.		0.00	0.00	34.00
And what you find is when you do something fun, it has a square wave walk set.	Ihe ị na-achọkwa bụ mgbe ị na-eme ihe na-atọ ụtọ, ọ na-eji ụkwụ aga ije.		0.00	0.00	15.00
When you do something philanthropic to help another person, it lasts and it lasts.	Mgbe ị na-eme ihe ndị na-akpali agụụ mmekọahụ iji nyere onye ọzọ aka, ọ na-ewe oge, ọ na-adịkwa otú ahụ.		0.00	0.00	20.00
So those are examples of positive interventions.	Ya mere, ndị ahụ bụ ihe atụ nke ihe ndị dị mma.		0.00	0.00	12.00
So, the next to last thing I want to say is we're interested in how much life satisfaction people have.	Ya mere, ihe sochirinụ m chọrọ ikwu bụ enweghị mmasị ná ndụ ndị mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	14.00
And this is really what you're about.	Nke a bụkwa ihe ị na-eme n’ezie.		0.00	0.00	7.00
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives, how much life satisfaction do you get?	Anyị na-ajụkwa ajụjụ ahụ dị ka ọrụ nke ndụ atọ ahụ dị iche, olee afọ ojuju ị na-enweta?		0.00	0.00	18.00
So we ask -- and we've done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure, the pursuit of positive emotion, the pleasant life, the pursuit of engagement, time stopping for you, and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction?	N’ihi ya, anyị na-ajụ onwe anyị ma na-adịghị ike ime nke a ná mbipụta 15 ndị metụtara ọtụtụ puku mmadụ ruo n’ókè ha aṅaa ka ịchụso ihe ụtọ, nchụso nke obi ụtọ, ndụ obi ụtọ, nchụso nke afọ ojuju, nchụso nke afọ ojuju, ịchụso nke afọ ojuju, na ịchụso ihe                  		0.00	0.00	67.00
And our results surprised us, but they were backward of what we thought.	Ihe anyị rụpụtara juru anyị anya, ma ha na-azụlite ihe anyị chere.		0.00	0.00	12.00
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction.	Ọ na-eme ka ịchụso ihe ụtọ bụrụ ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ ihe na-eme ka ndụ nwee afọ ojuju.		0.00	0.00	21.00
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest.	Ịchụso ihe ọ pụtara bụ ihe kasị sie ike.		0.00	0.00	9.00
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.	Ọchịchọ nke nkwekọrịta dịkwa nnọọ ike.		0.00	0.00	6.00
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning, then pleasure's the whipped cream and the cherry.	Ọ bụrụ na ihe na-atọ gị ụtọ bụ ma ọ bụrụ na i nwere ma nkwekọrịta ma nwee nzube, mgbe ahụ, obi dị gị ụtọ maka ihe ndị e kere eke a na-achịkwa achịkwa.		0.00	0.00	34.00
Which is to say, the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts, if you've got all three.	Onye nke ọ bụla n’ime ha ga-ekwu na ihe ndị e ji ebi ndụ dị ukwuu karịa akụkụ ahụ́ ndị ahụ, ọ bụrụ na ndị na-eto eto eruo atọ.		0.00	0.00	29.00
Conversely, if you have none of the three, the empty life, the sum is less than the parts.	N’aka nke ọzọ, ọ bụrụ na ọ dịghị nke ọ bụla n’ime mmadụ atọ ahụ, nke kasị baa uru, ego ahụ adịghị mma karịa akụkụ ahụ́ ndị ahụ.		0.00	0.00	28.00
And what we're asking now is does the very same relationship, physical health, morbidity, how long you live and productivity, follow the same relationship?	Nsogbu ndị dịkwa aṅaa ka ịjụ ugbu a bụ nnọọ mmekọrịta anụ ahụ́, ahụ́ ike, omume ọma, ogologo oge ha aṅaa ka ị na-adị ndụ ma na-arụpụta ihe, na-agbaso otu mmekọrịta ahụ?		0.00	0.00	32.00
That is, in a corporation, is productivity a function of positive emotion, engagement and meaning?	Nke ahụ bụ, n’otu akụkụ, ọ̀ na-eme ka mmadụ nwee mmetụta dị mma, nkwekọrịta na nzube?		0.00	0.00	16.00
Is health a function of positive engagement, of pleasure, and of meaning in life?	Ọ̀ bụ ọrụ ahụ́ ike nke inwe afọ ojuju, ihe ụtọ, na nzube nke ndụ?		0.00	0.00	15.00
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes.	E nwekwara ihe mere anyị ga-eji chee azịza nke abụọ n’ime ha pụrụ ịbụ ee.		0.00	0.00	15.00
So, Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard, and so this was amazing for me.	Ya mere, Chris kwuru na ọkà okwu ikpeazụ nwere ohere nke ịgbalị ibibi ihe ọ nụrụ, nke a bụkwa ihe ijuanya nye m.		0.00	0.00	23.00

But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology, entertainment and design in the following way.	Ma achọpụtara m na nsogbu ndị ọkà mmụta banyere akparamàgwà mmadụ yiri ka hà na-enwe nsogbu nke nkà na ụzụ, ntụrụndụ na ihe ndị na-esonụ.		0.00	0.00	25.00

And by the way, the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important.	N’ụzọ kwa, ọdịiche dị n’etiti nhụjuanya na iwuli elu dị nnọọ mkpa.		0.00	0.00	12.00
I thought, when I first became a therapist 30 years ago, that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed, not anxious, not angry, that I'd make them happy.	Echere m na mgbe mbụ m ghọrọ onye na-agwọ ọrịa afọ 30 gara aga, na ọ bụrụ na m dị mma ime ka mmadụ ghara ịda mbà n’obi, ọ bụghị iwe, na Ireld na-eme ka ha nwee obi ụtọ.		0.00	0.00	39.00
And I never found that.	Ahụtụbeghị m nke ahụ.		0.00	0.00	4.00
And it turns out the skills of happiness, the skills of the pleasant life, the skills of engagement, the skills of meaning, are different from the skills of relieving misery.	Ọ na-emekwa ka nkà nke obi ụtọ, nkà nke ndụ na-enye obi ụtọ, nkà nke inwe ihe ịga nke ọma, nkà nke nzube, dị iche na nkà nke nhụjuanya ndị a pụrụ ịdabere na ha.		0.00	0.00	35.00
And so, the parallel thing holds with technology, entertainment and design, I believe.	Otú ọ dị, ihe yiri nke ahụ nwere nkà na ụzụ, ntụrụndụ na ihe ndị e kere eke, ekweere m.		0.00	0.00	20.00
That is, it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness, to increase positive emotion, and that's typically how they've been used.	Nke ahụ bụ na ọ pụrụ ikwe ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala atọ a nke ụwa anyị omume ịmụba obi ụtọ, ịmụba mmetụta ndị dị mma, na-emekwa ka e jiri ha mee ihe n’ụzọ ụfọdụ.		0.00	0.00	33.00
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion, that's not nearly enough -- there's flow in life, and there's meaning in life.	Ma ozugbo ị na-eme ka obi na-atọ m ụtọ otú m si eche echiche nke ọma, ọ dịghị ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ọ fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ na ị na-enwe obi ụtọ ná ndụ, ọ bụkwa otú ahụ ka ọ dị ná ndụ.		0.00	0.00	49.00
As Laura Lee told us, design, and, I believe, entertainment and technology, can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well.	Dị ka Laura Lee gwara anyị, ihe ndị e kere eke, na, ekweere m, ntụrụndụ na nkà na ụzụ, a pụrụ iji mee ihe iji mụbaa ọganihu ná ndụ.		0.00	0.00	29.00
So in conclusion, the eleventh reason for optimism, in addition to the space elevator, is that I think with technology, entertainment and design, we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet.	N’ihi ya, ná ngwụsị, ihe nke asaa mere anyị ga-eji nwee olileanya, tinyekwara onye na-arụ ọrụ n’obí eze, bụ na m na-eche banyere nkà na ụzụ, ntụrụndụ na ihe ndị e kere eke, anyị pụrụ n’ezie ịmụba ọnụ ọgụgụ dị ukwuu nke inwe obi ụtọ n’ụwa.		0.00	0.00	46.00
And if technology can, in the next decade or two, increase the pleasant life, the good life and the meaningful life, it will be good enough.	Ọ bụrụkwa na nkà na ụzụ pụrụ, n’afọ iri na abụọ na-esonụ ma ọ bụ abụọ, na-amụba ndụ obi ụtọ, ndụ dị mma na ndụ nwere nzube, ọ ga-ezuru ya.		0.00	0.00	30.00
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion, meaning, eudaimonia, it will be good enough.	Ọ bụrụ na a pụrụ iwepụta ntụrụndụ iji mụbaa mmetụta dị mma, nke pụtara, nke pụtara, nke na-edozi ahụ́, ọ ga-adị mma.		0.00	0.00	22.00
And if design can increase positive emotion, eudaimonia, and flow and meaning, what we're all doing together will become good enough.

You see, the book was not driven by reading.	Ị na-ahụ, ọ bụghị ịgụ akwụkwọ ahụ.		0.00	0.00	7.00

But why is this so interesting?	Ma n’ihi gịnị ka nke a ji adọrọ mmasị?		0.00	0.00	9.00
It turns out that in the 1450s, the Catholic Church needed money, and so they actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences, which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.	Ọ na-eme ka ọ pụta ìhè na na na 14502, Chọọchị Katọlik chọrọ ego, n’ihi ya kwa, ha na-edetu ihe ndị a a na-akpọ indulges, bụ́ ndị a na-agbaghara ndị mmadụ n’akwụkwọ.		0.00	0.00	32.00
They traveled all around Europe and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.	Ha gara gburugburu Europe ma rere ya ọtụtụ narị puku mmadụ ma ọ bụ ọtụtụ puku mmadụ.		0.00	0.00	17.00
They got you out of purgatory faster.	Ha si n’apịtị pụta.		0.00	0.00	4.00
And when the printing press was invented what they found was they could print indulgences, which was the equivalent of printing money.	Mgbe e wepụtakwara ígwè obibi akwụkwọ ndị ahụ ihe ha chọpụtara bụ ihe ha pụrụ ibipụta, bụ́ nke na-akpata ego.		0.00	0.00	20.00
And so all of Western Europe started buying printing presses in 1455 -- to print out thousands, and then hundreds of thousands, and then ultimately millions of single, small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.	Otú ahụ ka ọ dịkwa n’ebe Ọdịda Anyanwụ Europe nile malitere ịzụta ígwè obibi akwụkwọ na 1455-ebipụta ọtụtụ puku, e mesịakwa, ọtụtụ narị puku mmadụ, ma mesịa, ọtụtụ nde mmadụ na-alụbeghị di ma ọ bụ nwunye, obere akwụkwọ ndị e ji ebi akwụkwọ bụ́ ndị sitere n’ọkụ ala mmụọ na banye n’eluigwe.		0.00	0.00	52.00
So the printing press, ladies and gentlemen, was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses and had nothing to do with reading.	N’ihi ya, a chụpụrụ ndị na-ebi akwụkwọ, ndị inyom na ndị ekpenta, site n’ibipụta mgbaghara, ọ dịghịkwa ihe ha ga-eme site n’ịgụ ihe.		0.00	0.00	23.00

Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.	Ikekwe anyị kwesịrị ikwu otu ihe ahụ banyere inwe olileanya.		0.00	0.00	10.00

Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases, and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000.	N’ime otu afọ, Congress ji ngwá agha ndị buru ibu na-amụba, anyị sikwa na 1,200 gaa ngwá agha nuklia ruo 20,000.		0.00	0.00	21.00

For example, some here will remember this day, June 1958, the National Civil Defense Drill, where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.

And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads.

Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago?	Ọ̀ na-eduga n’onye nna nanị ya na-azụ ụmụ n’ihe dị ka afọ 20, 25,000 gara aga?		0.00	0.00	16.00

I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.	Ekwenyesiri m ike na ha mere ihe ndị ahụ nile na ihe ndị a nile, ha nwekwara asụsụ nke oge a.		0.00	0.00	21.00

But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind.
