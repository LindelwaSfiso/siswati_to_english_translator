Un@@ less other@@ wise indic@@ ated , Scripture qu@@ ot@@ ations are from the modern - language New World Transl@@ ation of the Holy Scrip@@ tures .
Be@@ be had been very close to her father .
The re@@ mark came from a well - meaning family friend , but Be@@ be found it more cut@@ ting than comfor@@ ting .
“ His death was@@ n@@ ’@@ t for the best , ” she kept rep@@ eating to herself .
It was clear that when Be@@ be rec@@ oun@@ ted the inc@@ id@@ ent in a book years later , she was still griev@@ ing .
As Be@@ be came to see , it can take a long time for someone to overcome gri@@ ef , especially when the ber@@ ea@@ ved person was very close to the dec@@ eased .
In the Bible , death is ap@@ tly described as “ the last enemy . ”
It brea@@ ks into our lives with ir@@ resist@@ i@@ ble force , often when we are completely un@@ prepared , and it ro@@ bs us of those we hold dear .
None of us are imm@@ une to its ra@@ v@@ ages .
So it is not surpris@@ ing if we feel at a loss when it comes to cop@@ ing with death and its after@@ m@@ ath .
Perhaps you have won@@ dered : ‘ How long does it take to get over gri@@ ef ?
How can I comfort others who have been ber@@ ea@@ ved ?
Is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
Have you ever had a brief b@@ out with illness ?
As an example , consider how the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch Abraham re@@ acted when his wife died .
The Bible says that “ Abraham began to mourn and to weep over Sarah . ”
The expres@@ sion “ began to ” sugg@@ ests that it took some time for him to cop@@ e with his loss .
He gri@@ eved for “ many days , ” and his family members were unable to comfort him .
S@@ ever@@ al years later , the death of Joseph still weighed heav@@ ily on his mind . ​ — Genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ My husband , Rob@@ ert , died on July 9 , 200@@ 8 .
Si@@ x years later the pain in my heart is still there .
I don@@ ’@@ t think I will ever get over my loss of R@@ ob . ” ​ — G@@ ail , aged 60 .
“ Although I have been without my dear wife for more than 18 years , I still miss her and gri@@ eve over my loss .
Whenever I see something in nature that is attrac@@ tive , my thoughts go to her , and I cannot help wonder@@ ing how she would have enjoyed seeing what I am seeing . ” ​ — E@@ ti@@ enn@@ e , aged 8@@ 4 .
C@@ lear@@ ly , such pain@@ ful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
Each person griev@@ es in his or her own way , and it would be un@@ wise to judge the way another person respon@@ ds to tra@@ g@@ edy .
At the same time , we may need to hold off from condem@@ ning ourselves if our re@@ action to loss seems exc@@ essi@@ ve .
As we note in the “ Im@@ itate Their Faith ” article in this issue , Isaac was still griev@@ ing over the loss of his mother , Sarah , three years after her death . ​ — Genesis 24 : 6@@ 7 .
For inst@@ ance , you may find that some will adv@@ ise you not to cry or show your feelings in any way .
Others may p@@ ush you to do the opposite and exp@@ ose all your feelings .
The Bible presents a more bal@@ anced view , one that is supported by modern research .
In some cul@@ tures it is considered un@@ man@@ ly for a male to cry .
But is there a real need to feel ashamed about sh@@ ed@@ ding tears , even in public ?
M@@ ental - health exper@@ ts acknowledge that tear@@ fulness is a nor@@ mal part of griev@@ ing .
And griev@@ ing may , in time , help you to move on desp@@ ite the en@@ or@@ m@@ ity of your loss .
Sup@@ pres@@ sing gri@@ ef , how@@ ever , may do more harm than good .
The Bible l@@ ends no support to the no@@ tion that it is wrong or un@@ man@@ ly to shed tears of gri@@ ef .
At the death of his dear friend Lazar@@ us , Jesus open@@ ly wept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — John 11 : 33 - 35 .
B@@ ou@@ ts of anger are often part of griev@@ ing , especially in cases of sud@@ den , un@@ expected death .
There are many reasons why a ber@@ ea@@ ved person may feel angry , such as when thought@@ less and un@@ founded comments are made by a respected person .
“ I was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a South African man named Mi@@ ke .
“ At the fun@@ eral , the An@@ gl@@ ican minister said that God needs good people and takes them early .
* This ang@@ ered me because we des@@ per@@ ately needed our father .
E@@ speci@@ ally in the case of un@@ expected death , the ber@@ ea@@ ved person may rep@@ eat@@ edly think , ‘ It might not have happened if only I had done this or that . ’
If you are being plag@@ u@@ ed by such feelings of guilt and anger , it is important not to bott@@ le up these emo@@ tions .
Ra@@ ther , speak to a friend who will listen and re@@ ass@@ ure you that such ir@@ r@@ ational feelings are common to many ber@@ ea@@ ved ones .
The Bible remin@@ ds us : “ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ” ​ — Pro@@ verbs 17 : 17 .
The best Fri@@ end a ber@@ ea@@ ved person can have is our Cre@@ ator , Jehovah God .
P@@ our out your heart to him in prayer because “ he care@@ s for you . ”
More@@ over , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings s@@ oo@@ th@@ ed by “ the peace of God that sur@@ pass@@ es all understanding . ”
Also , allow God to help you heal by means of his con@@ sol@@ ing Word , the Bible .
Having such thoughts to pon@@ der over may be especially help@@ ful at night when you are alone and find it hard to sleep . ​ — Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 .
Rec@@ ently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call J@@ ack , lost his bel@@ ov@@ ed wife to canc@@ er .
“ When I pray to Jehovah , ” he explains , “ I never feel alone .
I often wake up during the night and cannot get back to sleep .
After reading and med@@ it@@ ating on comfor@@ ting thoughts from the Scrip@@ tures and then p@@ ouring out the feelings of my heart in prayer , I sense a cal@@ m@@ ness and a trans@@ cend@@ ing peace come over me , putting my mind and heart at rest and en@@ abl@@ ing me to sleep . ”
A young woman named V@@ an@@ ess@@ a lost her mother to illness .
She too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ In my most difficult times , ” she says , “ I would just call on God@@ ’@@ s name and break down in tears .
Jehovah listened to my prayers and always gave me the strength I needed . ”
Some ber@@ ea@@ vement counsel@@ ors adv@@ ise those who are struggl@@ ing with gri@@ ef to get involved in helping others or to volunte@@ er their time in some community service .
Do@@ ing so can bring joy and may ease a person@@ ’@@ s gri@@ ef .
Many ber@@ ea@@ ved Christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 Corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
God fe@@ els for you in your pain . ​ — Psal@@ m 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
God pati@@ ently list@@ ens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — Psal@@ m 8@@ 6 : 5 ; 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 17 .
God mis@@ ses people who have died . ​ — Job 14 : 13 - 15 .
God promises to resurrec@@ t the dead . ​ — Isaiah 26 : 19 ; John 5 : 28 , 29 .
Have you ever felt hel@@ pl@@ ess when someone near to you was griev@@ ing over the loss of a loved one ?
Sometimes we may feel un@@ sure of what to say or do ​ — so we wind up saying and doing nothing .
But there are practical , help@@ ful things that we can do .
O@@ f@@ ten , all that is needed is your presence along with a simple expres@@ sion , such as “ I am so sorry . ”
In many cul@@ tures , giving the person a hu@@ g or a gent@@ le squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze of the arm is an effective way to show you care .
If the ber@@ ea@@ ved one wants to talk , listen sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic@@ ally .
Best of all , do something for the ber@@ ea@@ ved family , perhaps per@@ forming a ch@@ ore the griev@@ ing one has not been able to care for , such as coo@@ king a meal , car@@ ing for the children , or helping with fun@@ eral arrang@@ ements if that is desired .
Such actions may speak lou@@ der than the most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent words .
In time , you may be moved to talk about the dec@@ eased , perhaps focus@@ ing on some good qual@@ ities or happy experi@@ ences .
Such convers@@ ation may even bring a sm@@ ile to the ber@@ ea@@ ved person@@ ’@@ s face .
For example , P@@ am ​ — who lost her husband , I@@ an , six years ago — ​ says : “ People sometimes tell me good things that I@@ an did that I never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
Res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers report that many ber@@ ea@@ ved people receive a lot of initi@@ al help but that their needs are soon forgotten as friends get bus@@ y again with their own lives .
Therefore , make a point of cont@@ acting a ber@@ ea@@ ved friend on a regular basis after the loss .
* Many griev@@ ing ones deeply appreci@@ ate this opportunity to reli@@ eve themselves of pro@@ long@@ ed feelings of gri@@ ef .
Consider the example of Ka@@ or@@ i , a young Japanese woman who was devast@@ ated by the loss of her mother followed by the loss of her older sister 15 months later .
Thank@@ fully , she received on@@ going support from lo@@ yal friends .
One named R@@ it@@ su@@ ko is much older than Ka@@ or@@ i and offered to be her close friend .
“ To be honest , ” says Ka@@ or@@ i , “ I was@@ n@@ ’@@ t happy about that .
I did@@ n@@ ’@@ t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and I did@@ n@@ ’@@ t think that anyone could .
How@@ ever , because of the way M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko treated me , I came to feel close to her .
Every week , we went out in the ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ zing work together and went to Christian meetings together .
She invited me to have te@@ a with her , brought me me@@ als , and wrote me letters and car@@ ds many times .
M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ k@@ o@@ ’@@ s positive att@@ itude had a good influence on me . ”
Twel@@ ve years have passed since Ka@@ ori@@ ’@@ s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ z@@ ers .
“ M@@ ama R@@ it@@ su@@ ko , ” Ka@@ or@@ i says , “ continues to show her concer@@ n .
When I go back home , I always visit her and enjoy her up@@ building associ@@ ation . ”
Another example of someone who benef@@ ited from on@@ going support is Pol@@ i , one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses in C@@ yp@@ rus .
Pol@@ i had a kind husband , So@@ z@@ os , who set a good example as a Christian shepher@@ d by often inv@@ iting or@@ ph@@ ans and wid@@ ows to their home for associ@@ ation and a meal .
Sad@@ ly , at the age of 5@@ 3 , So@@ z@@ os died of a brain t@@ um@@ or .
There , they began associ@@ ating with a congregation of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
“ The friends in my new congregation , ” rec@@ alls Pol@@ i , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
But that did not stop them from appro@@ aching us and embr@@ ac@@ ing us with their kind words and practical help .
How precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
Those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in Daniel .
One in particular made sure to include Daniel when enjo@@ ying associ@@ ation with friends or when going out to play ball . ”
Both mother and son are doing well today .
To be sure , there are many ways we can offer practical help and comfort to those who mourn .
The Bible also comfor@@ ts us by means of a thr@@ ill@@ ing hope for the future .
Some have even marked the date of the death on their cal@@ endar as a remin@@ der to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the date of the loss .
You may rec@@ all that G@@ ail , mentioned earli@@ er in this series , doub@@ ts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , R@@ ob .
How@@ ever , she is looking forward to seeing him again in God@@ ’@@ s promised new world .
My feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aware of this hope of seeing their loved one again . ”
So@@ on , God will do just that ​ — for Job and coun@@ t@@ less others — ​ when this earth is trans@@ formed into a par@@ ad@@ ise .
“ There is going to be a resurrection , ” the Bible confir@@ ms at Acts 24 : 15 .
“ Do not be amazed at this , ” Jesus as@@ sures us , “ for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tom@@ bs will hear his voice and come out . ”
He will have the prosp@@ ect of reg@@ ain@@ ing “ his you@@ th@@ ful v@@ ig@@ or , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ fre@@ sh@@ er than in youth . ”
The same will happen to all who respond with appreci@@ ation to God@@ ’@@ s merci@@ ful provision of a resurrection to life on earth .
If you have suffered the loss of someone dear to you , the information we have discussed may not completely take away your gri@@ ef .
But by med@@ it@@ ating on God@@ ’@@ s promises found in the Bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 13 .

In the spring of 33 C@@ .@@ E . , Jesus the Naz@@ aren@@ e was exec@@ uted .
He had been fal@@ sely charged with s@@ edition , sav@@ ag@@ ely beat@@ en , and n@@ ail@@ ed to a st@@ ake .
But God raised him back to life , and 40 days later , Jesus as@@ cend@@ ed to heaven .
This ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary account comes to us from the four G@@ osp@@ els of the Christian Greek Scrip@@ tures , comm@@ only called the New Testament .
On the other hand , if those events really did happen , then there is a bright future for man@@ kind , one in which you can share .
So , are the G@@ ospel accoun@@ ts fact or fic@@ tion ?
Un@@ like f@@ anci@@ ful leg@@ ends , the G@@ ospel writ@@ ings refl@@ ect pain@@ sta@@ king accur@@ acy and attention to det@@ ail .
For example , they ab@@ ound with names of real places , many of which can be vis@@ ited today .
They tell about real people , whose existence has been cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ated by sec@@ ular histor@@ ians . ​ — Luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
Jesus himself is mentioned by sec@@ ular writ@@ ers of the first and second centuri@@ es .
* His manner of death , as described in the G@@ osp@@ els , agre@@ es with Roman exec@@ u@@ tional methods of the time .
More@@ over , events are related in a fac@@ tual and can@@ did manner ​ — even portra@@ ying some of Jesus ’ disciples un@@ favor@@ ably .
All these factors strong@@ ly indic@@ ate that the G@@ ospel writ@@ ers were honest and accur@@ ate in what they wrote about Jesus .
While it is generally accepted that Jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
Even his apostles did not believe the initi@@ al report of his having returned to life .
All doubt was removed , how@@ ever , when they and other disciples saw the resurrec@@ ted Jesus on separate occas@@ i@@ ons .
In fact , in one case , there were more than 500 ey@@ e@@ witnesses present . ​ — 1 Corinthians 15 : 6 .
At the risk of being arrested and killed , the disciples coura@@ ge@@ ously proclaimed Jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had exec@@ uted him .
Would so many disciples have been so b@@ old if they were not absol@@ utely sure that Jesus had really been resurrec@@ ted ?
In fact , the reality of the resurrection of Jesus is the driving force behind the impact that Christi@@ anity has had on the world both then and now .
The G@@ ospel accoun@@ ts of Jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessary marks of an auth@@ enti@@ c histor@@ ical record .
C@@ are@@ fully reading them will convin@@ ce you that these events really happened .
Your convic@@ tion can be further strength@@ ened when you understand why they took place .
T@@ ac@@ it@@ us , born about 5@@ 5 C@@ .@@ E . , wrote that “ Christ@@ us , from whom the name [ Christians ] had its origin , suffered the ex@@ tre@@ me pen@@ alty during the reign of Ti@@ ber@@ i@@ us at the hands of one of our proc@@ ur@@ ators , P@@ on@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ at@@ us . ”
Jesus is also referred to by Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us ( first century ) ; Jewish histor@@ ian Josep@@ h@@ us ( first century ) ; and P@@ lin@@ y the Youn@@ ger , governor of B@@ ith@@ y@@ nia ( early second century ) .
Then , too , it is un@@ likely that Jesus ’ many oppos@@ ers would write anything that would l@@ end cre@@ di@@ bility to the reports about him .
Re@@ gar@@ ding Jesus ’ resurrection , Peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ God raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become man@@ if@@ est , not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed before@@ hand by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . ”
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s G@@ ospel tells us that when the religious enemies heard reports of Jesus ’ resurrection , they sch@@ emed to sup@@ press them . ​ — Matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
Does this mean that Jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept secret ?
No , for Peter went on to say : “ He ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thor@@ ough witness that this is the one decre@@ ed by God to be judge of the living and the dead . ”
True Christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — Acts 10 : 42 .
“ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — Romans 5 : 12
What would you say if you were asked , “ Do you want to live forever ? ”
Most people would probably say that they want to but that they feel it is un@@ real@@ istic to consider it .
Death is a nor@@ mal part of life , they say , the natural out@@ come of our existence .
Sup@@ pose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ Are you ready to die ? ”
Under nor@@ mal circumstances , most people would answer no .
The Bible shows that God created humans with the desire and the will to live .
In fact , it says that “ he has even put etern@@ ity in their heart . ” ​ — E@@ c@@ cl@@ es@@ ia@@ st@@ es 3 : 11 .
The reality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
Fur@@ ther@@ more , has God done anything to re@@ med@@ y the situation ?
The Bible@@ ’@@ s answers are heart@@ ening , and they have a direct bearing on why Jesus suffered and died .
The first three chap@@ ters of the Bible book of Genesis tell us that God set before the first human couple , Adam and E@@ ve , the prosp@@ ect of un@@ ending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
Then the account describes how they failed to obey God and lost that prosp@@ ect .
The story is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quick to dis@@ miss it as fol@@ k@@ l@@ ore .
But Genesis , like the G@@ osp@@ els , gives every ind@@ ication of being a fac@@ tual , histor@@ ical record .
What has been the result of Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s failure to obey ?
The Bible answers this way : “ Through one man [ Adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ”
He thus lost the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life and eventually died .
Being his descendants , we have inher@@ ited his sinful condition .
But has God done anything to re@@ med@@ y the situation ?
Y@@ es , God made arrang@@ ements to redeem , or buy back , what Adam had lost for his descendants , nam@@ ely , the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
“ The wages sin pa@@ ys is death , ” says the Bible at Romans 6 : 23 .
This means that death is the consequ@@ ence of sin .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , we sin and are therefore subject to sin@@ ’@@ s wages , death .
But we were born in this sinful condition through no fa@@ ult of our own .
So God lov@@ ingly sent his Son , Jesus , to accept ‘ the wages of sin ’ for us .
Jesus ’ death op@@ ens the way to a happy , end@@ less life
Since one man , the perfect man Adam , brought sin and death on us through dis@@ obedi@@ ence , a perfect man obedient even till death was needed to release us from that burden .
The Bible explains it this way : “ Just as through the dis@@ obedi@@ ence of the one man many were made sin@@ ners , so also through the obedi@@ ence of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
He left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our behalf .
As a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with God and gain the prosp@@ ect of end@@ less life .
Why , though , was it necessary for Jesus to die to accompl@@ ish this ?
C@@ ould not Almighty God have simply issued a decree that Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s descendants be allowed to live forever ?
H@@ ad God set justice aside in this inst@@ ance , people might have won@@ dered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
For example , would he be fair in determin@@ ing who among Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s offspring quali@@ fy for eternal life ?
C@@ ould he be tru@@ sted to keep his promises ?
God@@ ’@@ s ad@@ her@@ ence to justice in working out our salvation is ass@@ ur@@ ance to us that he will always do what is right .
By Jesus ’ sacri@@ f@@ icial death , God opened the way to end@@ less life in Par@@ ad@@ ise on earth .
Note Jesus ’ words as recorded at John 3 : 16 : “ God loved the world so much that he gave his only - be@@ gotten Son , so that everyone exerc@@ ising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
Jesus ’ death is thus an expres@@ sion not only of God@@ ’@@ s un@@ failing justice but , more speci@@ ally , of his great love for humans .
How@@ ever , why did Jesus have to suffer and die in the pain@@ ful way that was described in the G@@ osp@@ els ?
By subjec@@ ting himself to the ex@@ tre@@ me test and remaining faithful , Jesus refu@@ ted once and for all the Dev@@ il@@ ’@@ s claim that humans would not remain lo@@ yal to God when under trial .
That claim might have seemed val@@ id after Satan in@@ duc@@ ed perfect Adam to sin .
But Jesus ​ — who was Ad@@ am@@ ’@@ s perfect equi@@ val@@ ent — ​ remained obedient desp@@ ite severe suffering .
He thus proved that Adam too could have obeyed God if he had chosen to do so .
By end@@ uring under trial , Jesus left us a model to follow .
God rewar@@ ded his Son@@ ’@@ s perfect obedi@@ ence , gr@@ anting Jesus immor@@ tal life in heaven .
Jesus indic@@ ated what we need to do when he said : “ This means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true God , and the one whom you sent , Jesus Christ . ” ​ — John 17 : 3 .

During an assembly , a brother asked me if I would like to preach .
We went to the territory , and he gave me some book@@ l@@ ets about God@@ ’@@ s Kingdom .
One of the sist@@ ers there gave us children Bible less@@ ons based on the Bible and the book The Har@@ p of God .
As a teen@@ ag@@ er , I enjoyed giving people hope from God@@ ’@@ s Word .
The brother stopped his b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle and asked me to sit down with him on a log .
He said : “ Who gave you authority to judge who is a goat ?
Let@@ ’@@ s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judg@@ ing to Jehovah . ”
Another older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we sometimes have to endure pati@@ ently .
Y@@ ears later , his pati@@ ence was rewar@@ ded when his wife was baptized as one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .

When we arrived , I met and fell in love with Ma@@ x@@ ine B@@ oy@@ d , a beautiful mission@@ ary sister .
So I said to myself , ‘ R@@ on@@ al@@ d , if you want this girl , you@@ ’@@ ve got to act quickly . ’
After three weeks I proposed , and after six weeks we were married .
Ma@@ x@@ ine and I were assigned as mission@@ aries to Pu@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o , so I never went out on the new boat .
For example , in the village of Po@@ tal@@ a P@@ ast@@ ill@@ o , there were two Wit@@ ness families with many children , and I used to play the fl@@ ute for them .
I asked one of the little girls , H@@ ild@@ a , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
We bought her a pa@@ ir , and she came preaching with us .
She was about to leave for her assign@@ ment in E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , and she said : “ You don@@ ’@@ t recognize me , do you ?
I am the little girl from P@@ ast@@ ill@@ o who had no sho@@ es . ”
At first , L@@ enn@@ art John@@ son and I did most of the work .
Nathan K@@ nor@@ r , who was then taking the lead among Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , came to Pu@@ er@@ to R@@ ic@@ o .
Lat@@ er , he gave me strong counsel about being organ@@ ized and said that he was dis@@ appointed in me .
Father did not accept the truth when Mother and I did .
My dear wife , Ma@@ x@@ ine , died in 2011 .
I am really looking forward to seeing her again in the resurrection .

Some who come to see me want to discuss personal or family problems .

“ We also tell our older daughter , ‘ Have complete trust in Jehovah , keep bus@@ y in Kingdom service , and do not wor@@ ry too much . ’
When she sees the out@@ come , she knows that Jehovah is helping us .
This has done wonders for her faith in God and in the Bible . ”
The first article shows how our faith can grow and remain strong .
Let me explain what led to that convers@@ ation .
I W@@ A@@ S born in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , U@@ .@@ S.@@ A . , on December 10 , 19@@ 36 , the ol@@ dest of four children .
Then a soldi@@ er walked by , and the doctor y@@ elled , “ Do something about this yellow cow@@ ard ! ”
The soldi@@ er could see that the man was drun@@ k , so he told him , “ Go home and so@@ ber up ! ”
He owned two bar@@ ber@@ shop@@ s in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a , and the doctor was one of his cli@@ ents !
With my parents , going to a con@@ vention in W@@ ich@@ it@@ a in the 19@@ 40 ’ s
With Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s blessing and their z@@ eal@@ ous work , a congregation was started .
The brother also sold my car for $ 25 .
We were assigned to special pi@@ one@@ er in Wal@@ n@@ ut R@@ id@@ ge , Ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as .
Then in 196@@ 2 , we were thr@@ illed to receive an inv@@ itation to the 3@@ 7@@ th class of Gilead .
In the minist@@ ry in Na@@ i@@ rob@@ i with Mary and Ch@@ ris K@@ an@@ ai@@ ya
So@@ on after , our first daughter , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly , was born , and 17 months later , we had Steph@@ any .
We would also go cam@@ ping with them and would have very enjo@@ y@@ able convers@@ ations around the camp@@ fire .
We arranged to have some who were in the full - time minist@@ ry stay in our home .
They were shoc@@ ked and started to cry and said that they wanted to study .
With the help and direction of God@@ ’@@ s organization , we did our best to raise them to love Jehovah .
On a later trip , K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly met one of his work@@ m@@ ates , Bri@@ an L@@ le@@ well@@ y@@ n .
So they did stay free until they were at least 23 .
At the same time , Bri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly were invited to work at London Bethel and later were transfer@@ red to Mal@@ aw@@ i Bethel .
The day after we left for the Wat@@ ch@@ tower Educ@@ ational Center in P@@ atter@@ son , L@@ ind@@ a called to tell us that Mother had died .
Next , we taught the course in Zim@@ bab@@ we and then in Z@@ am@@ bia .
In 200@@ 6 , Bri@@ an and K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly moved next door to us to raise their two daughters , M@@ ack@@ en@@ z@@ ie and Elizab@@ eth .
Paul and Steph@@ any are still in Mal@@ aw@@ i , where Paul serves on the B@@ ran@@ ch Committee .

( b ) How can we reach our goal ?
We must recognize that when we prepare for the minist@@ ry , for the meetings , or for a talk , we may not necess@@ ar@@ ily apply what we read to ourselves .
Since my mind is main@@ ly involved in an int@@ ell@@ ec@@ tual exercise , my heart is not necess@@ ar@@ ily touched by the spiritual thoughts I am reading .
That is why I regularly set aside time to study the Bible and other publ@@ ications in my mother tongue . ”
“ It an@@ no@@ yed him to go out in the minist@@ ry in another language , wher@@ ea@@ s before he loved preaching in his native language , French , ” says M@@ uri@@ el .

For example , John explained : “ The one who exerc@@ ises faith in the Son has everlasting life ; the one who dis@@ obe@@ ys the Son will not see life , but the wrath of God remains upon him . ”
Com@@ pared with love , how important is faith ?
James asked his anointed brothers : “ Did not God choose those who are poor from the world@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point to be rich in faith and he@@ irs of the Kingdom , which he promised to those who love him ? ”

What hope did Jehovah give his people , and why was this promise remark@@ able ?
Would the Israelites ever again be able to worship God in a completely accep@@ table way ?
So it does not really seem that Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s people entered into captiv@@ ity to Babylon the Great in 19@@ 18 .
( Read Matthew 13 : 24 , 25 , 37 - 3@@ 9 . )
Would true Christians ever be free to worship God open@@ ly and accep@@ tab@@ ly ?

Then he remin@@ ded me of the good I was accompl@@ ishing .
He also remin@@ ded me of Jesus ’ words ​ — that each of us is worth more than many spar@@ rows .

There are many reasons why we should be thank@@ ful to Jehovah !
It also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
I was only eight years old at the time .
My father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
How@@ ever , I was c@@ urious and asked questions , so she stu@@ died with me when my father was out of the house .
As a result , I too decided that I wanted to dedic@@ ate my life to Jehovah .
My mother said that I should first speak to the servant to the bre@@ th@@ ren ( now called a cir@@ cu@@ it over@@ se@@ er ) .
He said , “ Go for it ! ”
After four months , I selected a brother as my pi@@ one@@ er partner .
My mother pi@@ one@@ ered with a sister in another congregation .
In 195@@ 1 , I filled out an application to attend the Wat@@ ch@@ tower Bible School of Gilead .

How can you experience “ the peace of God ” ?
How can the congregation help you to reduce anxi@@ ety ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What will we consider in this article ?
How , though , can you do that ?
The p@@ sal@@ mis@@ t David beg@@ ged Jehovah : “ Listen to my prayer , O God . ”
When we are an@@ x@@ ious , why is prayer so important ?
( Read Matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
What did Jesus mean when he said : “ Never be an@@ x@@ ious ” ?
He ad@@ mitted : “ My angu@@ ished heart makes me gro@@ an alou@@ d . ”

In the Ser@@ mon on the Mount , Jesus said : “ Re@@ jo@@ ice and be over@@ jo@@ yed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persec@@ uted the prophets prior to you . ”
Moses told the nation of Israel : “ Jehovah will surely bless you in the land that Jehovah your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you st@@ ric@@ tly obey the voice of Jehovah your God and carefully observe all this command@@ ment that I am giving you today .
For Jehovah your God will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
And he named the second one Ephraim , for he said , ‘ God has made me fruit@@ ful in the land of my afflic@@ tion . ’ ”
God@@ ’@@ s Word explains : “ For the joy that was set before him he end@@ ured a tor@@ ture st@@ ake , desp@@ ising shame . ”
Jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanc@@ ti@@ fy God@@ ’@@ s name .
How does Jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ The one showing favor to the low@@ ly is l@@ ending to Jehovah , and He will repay him for what he does . ”
What comfort do we find at 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( Read 1 John 3 : 19 , 20 . )
What are some of the rewar@@ ds that we enjoy now ?
How do Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s servants feel about the rewar@@ ds they receive ?
For example , Bi@@ anc@@ a from Germany says : “ I cannot thank Jehovah enough for helping me with my wor@@ ries and for being at my side each day .
The world out there is cha@@ o@@ tic and b@@ lea@@ k .
But as I work closely with Jehovah , I feel secure in his arms .
Whenever I make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hund@@ red@@ f@@ old in blessings . ”
For my own encoura@@ g@@ ement , I keep a not@@ eb@@ ook with scrip@@ tures and thoughts from our publ@@ ications that I can cons@@ ult from time to time .
I call it ‘ My Sur@@ vi@@ val Not@@ eb@@ ook . ’
Dis@@ coura@@ g@@ ement is temporary if we focus on Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s promises .
Jehovah is always there to help us , regard@@ less of our circumstances . ”
Yet , you can likely think of ways in which Jehovah has rewar@@ ded you and those around you .
How were Paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( Read Romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )

( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) What will we discuss in the next article ?
Why will we consider the examples of four kings of Judah ?
( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 32 : 31 . )
Many praise him for what he has done .
( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 35 : 20 - 22 . )
The Bible says that N@@ ec@@ ho@@ ’@@ s words were “ from the mouth of God . ”
Let us med@@ itate on these Bible accoun@@ ts and be thank@@ ful that Jehovah has provided them for us !
How many v@@ ows have you made to Jehovah ?
What about your d@@ ed@@ ication v@@ ow or your marriage v@@ ow ?
When we believe that we have person@@ ally experienced or ob@@ served an in@@ justice , our faith , hum@@ ility , and loy@@ alty may be tested .
“ The world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of God remains forever . ” ​ — 1 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 2 : 17 .
What will Jehovah do about wicked people and corrup@@ t organiz@@ ations ?
The Bible says : “ The world is passing away . ”
There is no darkness or deep shadow where wrong@@ do@@ ers can conc@@ eal themselves . ”
Lat@@ er in the same p@@ sal@@ m , we read : “ The righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
Who are “ the me@@ ek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
Why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organ@@ ized ?
After Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ d@@ on , will there be any organization on earth ?
So the “ new earth ” will be organ@@ ized .
What kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affected ?
What do we learn from Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s judgment of Sodom and G@@ omor@@ ra@@ h ?
( Read 2 Peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( Read Psal@@ m 4@@ 6 : 8 , 9 . )
What are some things that will be gone forever after Ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ d@@ on ?
Il@@ l@@ ustr@@ ate . ( b ) How can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is gone ?
“ W@@ IL@@ L the Jud@@ ge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
Because Jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
Christians expect to experience some in@@ justice outside the Christian congregation .
In 19@@ 4@@ 6 , he attended the eighth class of Gilead School in New York , U@@ .@@ S.@@ A .
After gradu@@ ation , he was eventually assigned to the cir@@ cu@@ it work in S@@ wit@@ z@@ er@@ land .
What examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
In this article , we will consider Abraham@@ ’@@ s great - grand@@ son Joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) What in@@ just@@ ices did Joseph experience ?
( Read Matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
L@@ oy@@ alty to Jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mist@@ ake .
Most important , he did not allow the im@@ perf@@ ec@@ tions and wrong actions of others to separate him from Jehovah .
Why should we draw even clos@@ er to Jehovah if we experience in@@ justice in the congregation ?
How can we show that we have confidence in “ the Jud@@ ge of all the earth ” ?
See W@@ ill@@ i Di@@ e@@ h@@ l@@ ’@@ s life story , “ Jehovah Is My God , in Wh@@ om I Will Tr@@ ust , ” in the November 1 , 199@@ 1 , issue of The Wat@@ ch@@ tower .
( See opening pictures . ) ( b ) What questions will be answered in this article ?
They are excellent examples for men and women today who choose to make v@@ ows to Jehovah .
How serious is it to make a v@@ ow to God ?
What less@@ ons can we learn from Jephth@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) What is a v@@ ow ?
( b ) What do the Scrip@@ tures say about making v@@ ows to God ?
( a ) How serious is it to make a v@@ ow to God ?
( b ) What do we want to learn about Jephth@@ ah and H@@ ann@@ ah ?
( a ) How easy was it for Jephth@@ ah and his daughter to pay his v@@ ow to God ?
Jephth@@ ah said : “ I have opened my mouth to Jehovah , and I am unable to turn back . ”
( b ) What did H@@ ann@@ ah@@ ’@@ s v@@ ow mean for Samuel ?
She took Samuel to High Pri@@ est El@@ i at the tabernacle in Shilo@@ h and said : “ It was for this boy that I prayed , and Jehovah granted my pet@@ ition that I asked of him .
The second most important v@@ ow that a person can make is the marriage v@@ ow .
What does the Bible say about divorce and separ@@ ation ?
( Read 1 Corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
One couple said : “ Since we have been stud@@ ying this bro@@ ch@@ ure , our marriage has been happ@@ i@@ er than ever . ”
We are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) What have many Christian parents done ?
( b ) What can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
Special full - time service v@@ ow ( See paragraph 19 )
It is not the people but their assign@@ ments that are view@@ ed as special .
See the App@@ en@@ di@@ x article “ The Bible@@ ʼ@@ s View on Di@@ v@@ or@@ ce and Sep@@ ar@@ ation ” in the book “ Keep Y@@ ourselves in God@@ ʼ@@ s Love . ”
Does the Almighty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integr@@ ity ? ”
( b ) How did Israel def@@ eat Jab@@ in@@ ’@@ s army ?
( Read Jud@@ ges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
The tor@@ ren@@ t of K@@ ish@@ on washed them away . ”
See the article “ An@@ xi@@ ety About Money ” in the July 1 , 2015 , issue of The Wat@@ ch@@ tower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) What in@@ justice did N@@ abo@@ th and his sons experience ?
( b ) What two qual@@ ities will we consider in this article ?
What kind of man was N@@ abo@@ th , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to King Ahab ?
N@@ abo@@ th was faithful to Jehovah at a time when most Israelites were following the bad example of King Ahab and his wife , wicked Queen Jez@@ e@@ bel .
Read 1 Kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
He respect@@ fully explained : “ It is un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , from Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s stand@@ point , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
Why would hum@@ ility have been a protection to N@@ abo@@ th@@ ’@@ s family and friends ?
( Read De@@ uter@@ onomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) In what ways will hum@@ ility protect us ?
How will you respond if the elders announ@@ ce a decision that you do not agree with ?
What account will we now consider , and why ?
How was Peter correc@@ ted , and what questions ar@@ ise ?
In fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the Bible .
3 Hel@@ ping “ Fore@@ ign Res@@ id@@ ents ” to “ Ser@@ ve Jehovah With Re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing ”
The second article consid@@ ers how applying Bible principles will help imm@@ ig@@ r@@ ant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ We could see people running , shoo@@ ting .
My parents and 11 of us si@@ bl@@ ings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our bac@@ ks .
How did Jesus and many of his disciples become refuge@@ es ?
He said : “ When they persec@@ ute you in one city , flee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
My feet were so sw@@ ol@@ l@@ en that I told my family to go on without me .
My father ​ — not about to aband@@ on me to the re@@ bel forces — ​ carried me .
They g@@ os@@ si@@ ped , drank , gam@@ bled , st@@ ole , and were immor@@ al . ”
( Read 1 John 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) Why do they need our patient help ?
They need to see that we care about them .
( b ) How can refuge@@ es show grat@@ itude ?
How can we help our brothers and sist@@ ers who are refuge@@ es ?
( a ) What temp@@ tation do refuge@@ es need to res@@ ist ?
Fin@@ ally , he held up the emp@@ ty ba@@ g and said with a sm@@ ile : ‘ You see ?
This is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — Read 1 Timothy 6 : 8 .
They need to sense Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s love and compassion among their fellow Christians .
Many of today@@ ’@@ s refuge@@ es come from countries where our preaching work is restric@@ ted .
She said : “ The brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shel@@ ter , and transp@@ ort@@ ation .
Who else would welcome strang@@ ers into their home just because they worship the same God ?
Only Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses ! ” ​ — Read John 13 : 35 .
As soon as possible after a refuge@@ e arri@@ ves , elders should follow the direction in Organ@@ ized to Do Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
In the mean@@ time , they can ask dis@@ cre@@ et questions about a refuge@@ e@@ ’@@ s congregation and minist@@ ry to discer@@ n his spiritual condition .
“ No greater joy do I have than this : that I should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 J@@ O@@ H@@ N 4 .
How can parents set a good example for their children ?
How can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
How can others help imm@@ ig@@ r@@ ant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What problem do many imm@@ ig@@ r@@ ant children experience ?
( b ) What questions will this article discuss ?
“ But after I started school , I began to pre@@ fer the local language .
With@@ in a few years , the shi@@ ft was complete .
I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t understand the meetings , and I did@@ n@@ ’@@ t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) How can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) What should parents not expect of their children ?
When your children see you “ seeking first the Kingdom , ” they learn to dep@@ end on Jehovah for their daily needs .
Never get so bus@@ y that you do not have time for your children .
How may your children benefit from learning your language ?
Paren@@ ts , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
A child who communic@@ ates best in another spoken language deser@@ ves the same concer@@ n , would you not agree ?
If that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love Jehovah .
“ But when we saw her stud@@ ying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know Jehovah was very important . ”
How can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) Who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
That may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
The answer was not what we person@@ ally found conven@@ i@@ ent .
But when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
Toge@@ ther , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the minist@@ ry .
We also invited local friends to join us for me@@ als and ex@@ cur@@ sions .
All of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know Jehovah , not only as their God but also as their Father and Fri@@ end .
We considered this to be much more important than their mast@@ ering our language . ”
Samuel ad@@ ds : “ To keep ourselves spiritu@@ ally strong , my wife and I also attended meetings in our language .
Life was very bus@@ y , and we were ti@@ red .
But we thank Jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
Our three children are all serving Jehovah in the full - time minist@@ ry . ”
“ I knew the bas@@ ics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” rec@@ alls K@@ rist@@ ina .
“ When I was 12 , I attended a con@@ vention in my school language .
For the first time , I understood that what I was hearing was the truth !
Another turning point came when I began to pray in my school language .
I could speak to Jehovah from my heart ! ”
Young people , do you think that you would pre@@ fer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ When my si@@ bl@@ ings and I got into our te@@ ens , we wanted to sw@@ itch to the local - language congregation , ” says Na@@ di@@ a , who now serves at Bethel .
“ Now we@@ ’@@ re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
It has en@@ rich@@ ed our lives and broad@@ ened our opportunities to help others get to know Jehovah . ”
( b ) How can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( Read Pro@@ verbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
Still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children@@ ’@@ s heart .
Both children and parents benefit from associ@@ ation with the congregation ( See parag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 18 , 19 )
( b ) What must parents continue to do ?
“ When they helped me with student talk assign@@ ments for the meeting , I always learned more .
And I enjoyed the le@@ is@@ ure activities we shared in as a group . ”
Paren@@ ts , pray to Jehovah for help , and try your best .
( Read 2 Chronic@@ les 15 : 7 . )
Put your child@@ ’@@ s friend@@ ship with Jehovah ahead of your own interests .
But it was@@ n@@ ’@@ t until 19@@ 4@@ 6 that I really understood Bible truth .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , I learned sign language and had fun playing with the other children .
She accepted a magaz@@ ine sub@@ s@@ cription and wanted me to meet her husband , G@@ ary .
Ev@@ ent@@ ually , five from their class became Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
At that time , she gave me a piece of cand@@ y and asked if we could be friends .
When she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ Bec@@ ome one of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
She continued her study and later got baptized .
When we got married in 19@@ 60 , her parents did not come to our wedding .
My son Nic@@ hol@@ as and his wife , De@@ bor@@ ah , serve at London Bethel
F@@ ay@@ e and James , Jer@@ ry and E@@ vel@@ y@@ n , Sh@@ ann@@ an and St@@ even
We are now part of the Cal@@ g@@ ary S@@ ign - Language Con@@ gre@@ gation , where I continue to serve as an el@@ der .
How can we keep our love for Jehovah strong ?
How can we deep@@ en our love for Bible truth ?
Why is it important to have aff@@ ection for our brothers ?
What may have caused the love of some Christians to grow cold ?
People today have less and less love for God .
This is the greatest and first command@@ ment . ”
Show love for Jehovah ( See paragraph 10 )
( Read Psal@@ m 11@@ 9 : 9@@ 7 - 100 . )
Show love for Bible truth ( See paragraph 14 )
On his last night on earth , Jesus said to his disciples : “ I am giving you a new command@@ ment , that you love one another ; just as I have loved you , you also love one another .
By this all will know that you are my disciples ​ — if you have love among yourselves . ” ​ — John 13 : 34 , 35 .
The apost@@ le John wrote : “ The one who does not love his brother , whom he has seen , cannot love God , whom he has not seen . ”
Show love for the brothers and sist@@ ers ( See paragraph 17 )
What are some ways in which we can show love ?
Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 4 : 9 , 10 .
“ Simon son of John , do you love me more than these ? ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 21 : 15 .
Then he said to them : “ ‘ C@@ ast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find some . ’
So they cast it , but they were not able to ha@@ ul it in because of the large number of fish . ” ​ — John 21 : 1 - 6 .
( b ) What valu@@ able lesson did a brother in Th@@ ail@@ and learn about his work ?
As a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
I finally realized that in order to put Kingdom interests first , I needed to change my line of work . ”
“ After planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ I decided to become a street v@@ end@@ or and sell ice cre@@ am .
In the beginning , I struggl@@ ed fin@@ anci@@ ally and got dis@@ coura@@ ged .
When I met my former work@@ m@@ ates , they would lau@@ gh at me and ask why I thought selling ice cre@@ am was better than working with comp@@ ut@@ ers in an air - condition@@ ed environment .
I prayed to Jehovah , asking him to help me to cop@@ e and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
I got better acqu@@ ainted with my customers ’ tast@@ es and became more skill@@ ful in making ice cre@@ am .
So@@ on , I was selling all my ice cre@@ am every day .
Ac@@ tu@@ ally , I was better - off fin@@ anci@@ ally than when I worked with comp@@ ut@@ ers .
It has made me happ@@ i@@ er because I do not have the stress and wor@@ ry that I had with my former job .
And most important , I now feel clos@@ er to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
After his bap@@ tism , he said : “ The only regre@@ t I have is that I lost so much time before I realized that serving Jehovah brings far more happiness than pursu@@ ing the enter@@ tain@@ ment offered by this world . ”
Jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two mast@@ ers . ”
He added : “ You cannot slave for God and for R@@ ich@@ es . ”
( Read 1 Corinthians 2 : 14 . )
See the article “ Is Your Rec@@ re@@ ation Benef@@ icial ? ”
We also shared regularly in the field minist@@ ry . ”
We were so sa@@ d to leave our Bible students behind . ”
But then , a month later , they received thr@@ ill@@ ing news .
M@@ iri@@ am says : “ We were invited to serve as special pi@@ one@@ ers .
What a joy to be able to stay in our assign@@ ment ! ”
They tru@@ sted in the promise found at Psal@@ m 37 : 5 : “ Comm@@ it your way to Jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”
Today we do , and we lack nothing of real importance . ”
Why can we expect that marriage and family life will invol@@ ve some tri@@ als ?
We can be sure that he wants the best for us , as he did for his servants in the past . ​ — Read Jeremiah 29 : 11 , 12 .
( Read 1 Samuel 1 : 4 - 7 . )
“ Even though An@@ n was not related to me , I found her loving concer@@ n to be such a help , ” Paul@@ a explains .
“ It helped me to keep serving Jehovah . ”
( Read Psal@@ m 14@@ 5 : 18 , 19 . )
“ Where your treas@@ ure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ K@@ E 12 : 34 .
As we do so , med@@ itate on how you person@@ ally can deep@@ en your love for these spiritual treasures .
Can you imag@@ ine how precious that p@@ ear@@ l was to him ?
( Read Mark 10 : 28 - 30 . )
( a ) Why did the apost@@ le Paul describe our minist@@ ry as a “ treas@@ ure in ear@@ then ves@@ sel@@ s ” ?
( Read Romans 1 : 14 , 15 ; 2 Timothy 4 : 2 . )
Some of them serve as Beth@@ el@@ ites , pi@@ one@@ ers , and elders .
I@@ ren@@ e says , “ When I think of other goals I could have pursu@@ ed , I can@@ ’@@ t imag@@ ine one that would have brought me more joy . ”
What is the “ treas@@ ure store ” that Jesus referred to at Matthew 13 : 5@@ 2 , and how do we fill it ?
( Read Pro@@ verbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
Consider the experience of a brother named Peter .
To test Peter , the ra@@ bb@@ i asked , “ So , my boy , what language was the book of Daniel written in ? ”
When I went home and chec@@ ked the Wat@@ ch@@ tower and A@@ wake !
magaz@@ ines from the previous months , I found an article explain@@ ing that Daniel was written in Aram@@ a@@ ic . ”
As you do this , you will build up “ treas@@ ure in the heavens , where no thief gets near and no mo@@ th consum@@ es .
For where your treas@@ ure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — Luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ I had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
Once when we were y@@ elling at each other , two people came in and witness@@ ed our b@@ low@@ up . ” ​ — C@@ H@@ R@@ I@@ S .
“ A sister with whom I often preached suddenly ended our arrang@@ ements for the minist@@ ry .
I had no idea why . ” ​ — J@@ AN@@ E@@ T .
“ I was on a three - person phone call .
“ In our congregation , two pi@@ one@@ ers began having problems .
Their b@@ ick@@ ering was dis@@ coura@@ ging to others . ” ​ — G@@ AR@@ Y .
“ Do not become up@@ set with one another on the way . ”
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no consult@@ ation . ”
Michael says , “ My brother gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely for@@ gave me . ”
“ Contin@@ ue putting up with one another and for@@ giving one another fre@@ ely even if anyone has a cause for complain@@ t against another . ”
Now they get along well as they preach the good news .
That difference may seem un@@ important ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
As my ir@@ rit@@ ation grew , I started being cur@@ t with her .
I thought , ‘ She does not show me the respect I deserve , so I am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ I began seeing my own person@@ ality f@@ laws , and I was very dis@@ appointed in myself .
I realized that I had to ad@@ just my thinking .
After praying to Jehovah about the matter , I bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apo@@ logi@@ ze for my bad att@@ itude .
We hu@@ g@@ ged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
We have not had any more problems . ”
F@@ O@@ R many people today , money is the big issue .
Why must the issue of s@@ overe@@ ign@@ ty be settled ?
How important is the v@@ ind@@ ication of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s s@@ overe@@ ign@@ ty ?
Why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continu@@ ing exactly as they were from cre@@ ation@@ ’@@ s beginning . ”
( Read Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 10 , 11 . )
( Read Job 1 : 7 - 12 . )
( Read Job 38 : 18 - 21 . )
( Read Romans 5 : 3 - 5 . )
One reason is that he rules with love .
He care@@ s for us better than we can care for ourselves .
How can elders and family heads im@@ itate Jehovah ?
Psal@@ m 14@@ 7 rep@@ eat@@ edly encoura@@ ges God@@ ’@@ s people to praise Jehovah .
What was it about Jehovah that impres@@ sed the p@@ sal@@ mis@@ t so much that he wanted God to be praised ?
Many young brothers and sist@@ ers are z@@ eal@@ ously entering the full - time service .
“ Make friends for yourselves by means of the un@@ righteous riches . ” ​ — L@@ U@@ K@@ E 16 : 9 .
How can we avoid becoming slaves of today@@ ’@@ s commercial world ?
In this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
What can we learn from Jesus ’ counsel ?
How do we know that today@@ ’@@ s commercial system was not part of God@@ ’@@ s purpose ?
Give examples of how some are showing faithfulness in their use of un@@ righteous riches .
I am more gener@@ ous in being for@@ giving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept dis@@ appoint@@ ments and counsel . ”
( Read 2 Corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
How did Abraham show that he tru@@ sted in God ?
( b ) How can we apply Paul@@ ’@@ s counsel today ?
After calling Timothy “ a fine soldi@@ er of Christ Jesus , ” Paul told him : “ No man serving as a soldi@@ er involves himself in the commercial business@@ es of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who en@@ rolled him as a soldi@@ er . ”
Jehovah bless@@ es those who are “ rich in fine works . ”
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 17 - 19 . )

“ F@@ O@@ R almost a year after the death of our son , we felt deep and exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pain , ” said Sus@@ i .
Every single time , the peace of God truly gu@@ ard@@ ed our hearts and minds . ” ​ — Read Philipp@@ ians 4 : 6 , 7 .
How did Jesus show em@@ pa@@ thy when Lazar@@ us died ?
If you are griev@@ ing , you too can find s@@ oo@@ thing comfort from such scrip@@ tures as the following :
( Read 1 Th@@ ess@@ al@@ oni@@ ans 5 : 11 . )
What do we need to remember about gri@@ ef ?
Even when someone does express how he fe@@ els , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
At that moment , I don@@ ’@@ t feel quite so alone in my gri@@ ef . ”
“ Rec@@ ei@@ ving a short encoura@@ ging message or an inv@@ itation to spend time with a fellow Christian helps me more than I can say , ” says J@@ un@@ ia .
“ Those expres@@ sions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ Sometimes when sist@@ ers have come to comfort me , ” rec@@ alls D@@ al@@ en@@ e , “ I have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
They start praying , often batt@@ ling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sent@@ ences , their voice gets stronger and they say the most heart@@ felt prayer .
Their strong faith , their love , and their concer@@ n have been very faith - strength@@ ening . ”
“ A true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”
“ I expected my first wedding an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary to be very tra@@ um@@ atic , ” rel@@ ates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
But a few brothers and sist@@ ers planned a small gather@@ ing of my clos@@ est friends so that I wou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t be on my own . ”
“ O@@ f@@ ten the help and compani@@ on@@ ship offered when there is no special an@@ ni@@ vers@@ ary can be very benef@@ icial , ” explains J@@ un@@ ia .
“ Those spon@@ t@@ an@@ e@@ ous mom@@ ents are so valu@@ able and bring much comfort . ”
They have truly made me feel Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s loving arms around me . ”
Why are Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s promises a source of great comfort ?
God promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will wi@@ pe away the tears from all faces . ”
Other scrip@@ tures that many have found comfor@@ ting are Psal@@ m 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 5@@ 5 : 22 ; 12@@ 1 : 1 , 2 ; Isaiah 5@@ 7 : 15 ; 6@@ 6 : 13 ; Philipp@@ ians 4 : 13 ; and 1 Peter 5 : 7 .
See also the article “ Com@@ for@@ t the Ber@@ ea@@ ved , as Jesus Did ” in the November 1 , 2010 , issue of The Wat@@ ch@@ tower .
“ We don@@ ’@@ t know what to say except that we love you .
We can@@ ’@@ t understand exactly how you feel , but Jehovah does and will keep raising you up .
We hope that our prayers will help a little . ”
“ May Jehovah su@@ st@@ ain you at this time of such great loss . ”
“ May you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of God , who will remember every det@@ ail about him and bring him back again . ”
“ Your loved one will never have to face the last enemy , death , ever again .
In the mean@@ time , his acts of faith live on until he stands up alive and whole in the Par@@ ad@@ ise . ”
“ While words fail to capture the pain of lo@@ sing a loved one , we look forward to the time when words will fail to capture the joy of having our heavenly Father return your dear one to you . ”

What plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
What could a life in the pi@@ one@@ er service lead to ?
YOU young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
Life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
How do you know that Jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
Your Cre@@ ator is “ the God of love , ” “ the happy God , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
You will be happy when you im@@ itate our loving God .
Jesus Christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
Jesus also drew close to Jehovah by stud@@ ying the Scrip@@ tures .
“ Pl@@ ans fail when there is no consult@@ ation , but there is accompl@@ ishment through many advis@@ ers . ”

At first , I cou@@ ld@@ n@@ ’@@ t start any Bible studies , but later I moved to another territory , and within a month I started several studies .
One student began coming to the Kingdom H@@ all .
For example , Jacob , from North Americ@@ a , wr@@ ites : “ When I was seven , many of my class@@ m@@ ates were Viet@@ nam@@ ese .
I wanted to tell them about Jehovah , so after a while I made plans to learn their language .
For the most part , I learned by compar@@ ing the English and Viet@@ nam@@ ese ed@@ itions of The Wat@@ ch@@ tower .
I also made friends in a near@@ by Viet@@ nam@@ ese - language congregation .
When I was 18 , I started pi@@ one@@ ering .
Lat@@ er , I attended the Bible School for Sing@@ le Bro@@ thers .
This helped me with my present pi@@ one@@ er assign@@ ment , where I am the only el@@ der in a Viet@@ nam@@ ese - language group .
Many Viet@@ nam@@ ese people are amazed that I have learned their language .
They invite me in , and often I can study the Bible with them .
Some have prog@@ ressed to bap@@ tism . ” ​ — Comp@@ are Acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
I enjoy encoura@@ ging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
After I attended the Bible School for Sing@@ le Bro@@ thers , I received a new pi@@ one@@ er assign@@ ment .
It@@ ’@@ s true that I have never found anyone in the territory who prog@@ ressed to bap@@ tism , but others have .
How may pi@@ one@@ er service lead to other opportunities ?
A brother named K@@ ev@@ in says : “ E@@ ver since I was a little boy , I have wanted to serve Jehovah full - time som@@ ed@@ ay .
Fin@@ ally , I started pi@@ one@@ ering when I was 19 .
I supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a build@@ er .
I learned to inst@@ all ro@@ of@@ s , wind@@ ows , and doors .
Lat@@ er , I spent two years with a hur@@ ric@@ ane relief team , re@@ building Kingdom H@@ alls and homes for the brothers .
When I heard about the construction needs in South Africa , I applied and was invited to go .
Here in Africa , I move from one Kingdom H@@ all project to another every few weeks .
We live together , study the Bible together , and work together .
Bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for Jehovah .
After a year and a half , I was invited to Bethel , where I learned to oper@@ ate prin@@ ting pres@@ ses and later to do compu@@ ter program@@ ming .
At Bethel , I enjoy hearing fir@@ s@@ th@@ and about the progress of the dis@@ ci@@ ple - making activity world@@ wide .
I love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to Jehovah . ”
You can be sure that Jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( Read 1 Timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
Then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
He has stu@@ died human behavior since man was created .
It@@ ’@@ s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ Do not let them lead you into disaster ! ”
Jesus said : “ Do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
Do not be struck with terror or fear , for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go . ”
Listen to Jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
The second article high@@ lights how Jehovah can do the un@@ expected by accompl@@ ishing things we could never imag@@ ine .
Like the farm@@ er , we need to wait pati@@ ently .
What can we learn from the example of the prophet Mic@@ ah ?
( Read Mic@@ ah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
If we have faith like that of Mic@@ ah , we will be willing to wait for Jehovah .
So we “ endure fully with pati@@ ence and joy . ”
Abraham had to wait many years before his grand@@ sons Esau and Jacob were born ( See parag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s 9 , 10 )
( Read Hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
But just imag@@ ine Abraham@@ ’@@ s joy when he is resurrec@@ ted back to a par@@ ad@@ ise earth .
Although you meant to harm me , God intended it to turn out well and to preser@@ ve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) What helped David to wait pati@@ ently ?
I will sing to Jehovah , for he has rich@@ ly rewar@@ ded me . ”
( Read 2 Peter 3 : 9 . )
What will help us to be willing to wait pati@@ ently ?
What less@@ ons do we learn from what happened to the apost@@ le Paul in Philipp@@ i ?
( Read Acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
So@@ on after he arrived in Mac@@ edon@@ ia , he ended up in prison !
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to Paul ?
Both he and Sil@@ as started “ praying and pra@@ ising God with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) How could our situation be similar to that of Paul ?
( b ) How did Paul@@ ’@@ s situation change un@@ expect@@ edly ?
What will we now discuss and review together ?
( Read 1 Peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
We need to act in har@@ mony with our prayers .
Sometimes he surpris@@ es us by doing the un@@ expected .
Jehovah sent an angel to destroy 18@@ 5@@ ,000 of S@@ enn@@ ac@@ her@@ i@@ b@@ ’@@ s soldiers in one night .
( a ) What lesson do we learn from what happened to Joseph ?
No doubt Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s actions exc@@ eeded all of Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s expect@@ ations .
Think , too , about Josep@@ h@@ ’@@ s great - grand@@ mother Sarah .
( Read Isaiah 4@@ 3 : 10 - 13 . )
We know that Jehovah care@@ s for us and wants us to succ@@ eed .
How can we stri@@ p off and keep off the old person@@ ality ?
By 19@@ 3@@ 9 there were 6@@ ,000 of them in the [ con@@ cent@@ ration cam@@ ps ] . ”
And you people have clean@@ ed the sta@@ dium so nic@@ ely .
But most of all , you are truly multi@@ rac@@ ial . ”
But the more I had sexual relations , the more in@@ secure I felt . ”
This way of life continued until Sa@@ k@@ ur@@ a was 23 years old .
It got so bad that I could not wait for the woman I was living with to leave the house so that I could watch por@@ no@@ grap@@ hic videos . ”
What helped Steph@@ en to put away anger and ab@@ usi@@ ve speech ?
He says : “ Our family life impro@@ ved dram@@ at@@ ically .
Today , Steph@@ en serves as a minist@@ eri@@ al servant , and his wife has been a regular pi@@ one@@ er for several years .
Bible tex@@ ts that encouraged me were Isaiah 5@@ 5 : 7 , which says : ‘ Let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 Corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ And yet that is what some of you were . ’
For many years , Jehovah pati@@ ently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new person@@ ality . ”
We also benefit from God@@ ’@@ s Word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
Some of the names in this article have been changed .
See chapter 25 in the book Ques@@ tions Young People Ask ​ — Answ@@ ers That Work , Vol@@ ume 1 .
( Read Co@@ los@@ si@@ ans 3 : 10 - 14 . )
He stated : “ There is neither Greek nor Je@@ w , circumc@@ ision nor uncircumc@@ ision , foreign@@ er , S@@ cy@@ th@@ ian , slave , or fre@@ em@@ an . ”
( a ) How do servants of Jehovah need to treat others ?
( See opening picture . ) ( b ) What have been the results ?
Then he attended a meeting of Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses .
You get to experience our world@@ wide brother@@ hood and see its miraculous un@@ ity fir@@ s@@ th@@ and . ”
When we showed them scrip@@ tures from their Por@@ tu@@ gu@@ ese Bible , such as Revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or Psal@@ m 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they paid attention and sometimes even shed tears . ”
We are so thank@@ ful to Jehovah . ” ​ — Read Acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
What example did Jesus set in showing m@@ ild@@ ness and pati@@ ence ?
Just as Jehovah fre@@ ely for@@ gave you , you must also do the same . ”
Then he added : “ If you continue showing favor@@ it@@ ism , you are comm@@ itting sin . ”
Why is it important that we clo@@ the ourselves with love ?
Love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get pu@@ ff@@ ed up . ”
Paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
The love is in this respect , not that we have loved God , but that he loved us and sent his Son as a pro@@ p@@ iti@@ atory sacrifice for our sins . ”
Jesus said : “ No one has love greater than this , that someone should sur@@ ren@@ der his life in behalf of his friends . ”
Let us consider how we can do so .
John wrote : “ Little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in de@@ ed and truth . ”
But then I asked myself , ‘ How can I im@@ itate Jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
After refl@@ ecting on what Jesus would have done , I decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
Lat@@ er , I learned that my cow@@ or@@ ker had been cop@@ ing with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
I conclud@@ ed that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
Re@@ fl@@ ecting on Jesus ’ example of showing love even when provo@@ ked helped me to show similar love to my cow@@ or@@ ker . ”
By leaving heaven , “ he emp@@ tied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
P@@ E@@ AC@@ E : “ P@@ ut@@ ting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the un@@ iting b@@ ond of peace . ”
Would you not agree that such a peac@@ eful spirit is truly unique in today@@ ’@@ s divided world ?
Paul wrote : “ Love buil@@ ds up . ”
The following day , they had out@@ grown the ven@@ ue . ”
Bel@@ ow the picture was the cap@@ tion : “ Inv@@ as@@ ion of the streets . ”
One congregation wrote , “ The only line that pass@@ es near this place is a t@@ ele@@ grap@@ h line . ”
In Mexic@@ o , 2@@ ,@@ 26@@ 2@@ ,@@ 6@@ 4@@ 6 people attended the Mem@@ orial in 2016 .
Matthe@@ w@@ ’@@ s account focuses on events that involved Joseph .

How can you prepare yourself to res@@ ist temp@@ t@@ ations ?
What experience did one brother have , and why are our re@@ actions in similar situ@@ ations important ?
In what ways can parents help their children to develop self - control ?
How can you help your children to develop self - control ?
( Read Ex@@ od@@ us 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) Why should you be interested in what the Bible says about compassion ?
( a ) Why did Jehovah send angels to Sodom ?
( Read Ex@@ od@@ us 22 : 26 , 27 . )
We read : “ Jehovah the God of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”
“ He started to teach them many things . ”
Inst@@ ead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
One meaning of compassion is “ to suffer together . ”
“ Be coura@@ ge@@ ous and strong and go to work .
How can young ones and their parents show courage ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) What important assign@@ ment did Solomon receive ?
To succ@@ eed , Solomon would need to be coura@@ ge@@ ous and go to work .
What could Solomon learn about courage from his father ?
( Read 1 Chronic@@ les 28 : 20 . )
How did Jesus ’ courage affect the apostles ?
Let us consider two areas of life where we need courage : in our family and in the congregation .
( b ) How can young ones im@@ itate Moses ’ example ?
He will help them provide for the needs of their families .
With the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young Christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pi@@ one@@ er .
How can Psal@@ m 37 : 25 and Hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( Read Psal@@ m 37 : 25 ; Hebrews 13 : 5 . )
A brother who has two children wrote : “ Many parents exp@@ end much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , rec@@ re@@ ation , and education .
It makes so much more sense to exp@@ end effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with Jehovah .
It has been a great source of satisfac@@ tion not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
Give examples of courage in the Christian congregation .
( a ) How can baptized brothers be coura@@ ge@@ ous ?
( Read Philipp@@ ians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
We urge all baptized brothers to be coura@@ ge@@ ous and work hard for the congregation !
Therefore , “ be coura@@ ge@@ ous . . . and go to work . ”
1 , 2 . ( a ) What would life be like without the Bible ?
The apost@@ le Peter qu@@ oted Isaiah 40 : 8 .
( Read 1 Peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) How do languages change over time ?
( Read Revelation 14 : 6 , foot@@ note . )
Lat@@ er prin@@ t@@ ings also used the word “ LORD ” in capital letters in some ver@@ ses in the Christian Greek Scrip@@ tures .
Why are we grateful for the New World Transl@@ ation ?
( b ) What is the Greek Sep@@ tu@@ ag@@ int ?
( Read Psal@@ m 11@@ 9 : 16@@ 2 - 16@@ 5 . )
What will we consider in the following article ?
See the article “ Do You Ne@@ ed to Learn Hebrew and Greek ? ”
in the November 1 , 2009 , issue of The Wat@@ ch@@ tower .
On April 3 , 2017 , a Bible mus@@ eum opened at our world head@@ qu@@ art@@ ers in War@@ w@@ ick , New York , U@@ .@@ S.@@ A .

What responsibility do brothers who teach from the plat@@ form have ?
Are we not grateful to Jehovah for his written Word , the Bible ?
See the box “ A Tur@@ ning Point . ”
Take time to explain , illustr@@ ate , and apply ver@@ ses that you read
“ A turning point came about 15 years after I was baptized .
During a talk at the Kingdom H@@ all . . . , the spea@@ ker referred to James 1 : 23 , 24 .
Those ver@@ ses li@@ ken God@@ ’@@ s Word to a mir@@ ror in which we can see ourselves the way Jehovah sees us .
I began to wonder if what I saw in myself was different from what Jehovah saw .
At first , I resist@@ ed this new idea .
I still felt that loving me was too much to expect of Jehovah .
“ A few days later , I read a scrip@@ ture that changed my life .
The verse was Isaiah 1 : 18 , where Jehovah is qu@@ oted as saying : ‘ Come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
Though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like s@@ now . ’
I felt as if Jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ Come on , V@@ ick@@ y , let@@ ’@@ s set matters straight between us .
I know you , I know your sins , I know your heart ​ — and I love you . ’
“ I was unable to sleep that night .
I still doub@@ ted that Jehovah could love me , but I began thinking about Jesus ’ rans@@ om sacrifice .
All of a sud@@ den , it daw@@ ned on me that Jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
Yet , I was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ Your love is not great enough to reach me .
Your Son@@ ’@@ s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
It was as if I had been throw@@ ing the rans@@ om back at Jehovah .
But now , at last , by med@@ it@@ ating on this gift of the rans@@ om , I began to feel loved by Jehovah . ”
These articles discuss Zechar@@ iah@@ ’@@ s sixth , seventh , and eighth visions .
First , let me tell you about my background .

My brother and his wife , L@@ ot@@ tie , were already serving as special pi@@ one@@ ers in Northern I@@ re@@ land , and in 195@@ 2 the four of us attended a district con@@ vention in Bel@@ fast .
That night the four of us sl@@ ept in the car .

What will happen to some anointed ones during Christ@@ ’@@ s presence ?
For if we have faith that Jesus died and rose again , so too God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in death . . .
We the living who survive to the presence of the Lord will in no way prec@@ ed@@ e those who have fallen asleep in death ; because the Lord himself will des@@ c@@ end from heaven with a command@@ ing call , . . . and those who are dead in union with Christ will rise first .
Ano@@ in@@ ted ones who are alive during the great tri@@ bul@@ ation will be “ caught away in clouds . ”
If you come back , I will break your legs . ”

I enjoyed reading the Bible , especially the four G@@ osp@@ els .
Do@@ ing so made me want to follow Jesus ’ example . ​ — John 10 : 27 .
About that time , my parents asked me to come back home .
One older Wit@@ ness came to our house and explained what the Bible says about “ the last days . ”

( Read Isaiah 6@@ 3 : 9 ; Mark 6 : 34 . )
Rachel , a sister in Bra@@ z@@ il , says : “ I loved to follow the world@@ ’@@ s fashi@@ ons .
As a result , I did not dress very mo@@ des@@ tly .
But learning the truth moved me to make the needed effort to be a spiritual person .
Making changes was not easy , but I became happ@@ i@@ er and found real purpose in life . ”
So being like Jesus makes us more like Jehovah .
They said : “ We are witnesses of all the things he did . ”
How will having the mind of Christ affect your daily life ?

The first question is , “ On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ , have you rep@@ ented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will ? ”
How can we be hosp@@ itable at our Christian meetings ?
( Read 3 John 5 - 8 . )

She had come to welcome the new mission@@ aries .
We invited her in and gave her a glass of water .
If you feel an@@ x@@ ious about having gu@@ ests , you are not alone .
An el@@ der in Brit@@ ain ad@@ m@@ its : “ There can be a measure of ner@@ v@@ ousness in preparing for gu@@ ests .
But as with anything in relation to serving Jehovah , the benefits and satisfac@@ tion that result far out@@ we@@ i@@ gh any anxi@@ ety .
I have enjoyed simply sitting down with gu@@ ests over coffee and talking . ”
Another el@@ der wr@@ ites : “ Having friends from the congregation to my home helps me to understand them better and gives me time to get to know them , especially how they came into the truth . ”
The wife of one of the instruc@@ tors really put me at ease .
She said that when she and her husband are serving in the travel@@ ing work , their best weeks are those spent staying with a spiritual person who may not have much materi@@ ally but who has the same focus as they have ​ — serving Jehovah and keeping life simple .
This remin@@ ded me of what my mu@@ m used to say to us as children : ‘ Bet@@ ter a dis@@ h of vegetables where there@@ ’@@ s love . ’ ”

The el@@ der rec@@ alled : “ Gra@@ ham had a problem with pride .
He was critical of the elders who had been involved in his dis@@ fellow@@ shi@@ pping .
So for the next few studies , we discussed scrip@@ tures on pride and its effects .
Gra@@ ham began to see himself clearly in the mir@@ ror of God@@ ’@@ s Word , and he did not like what he saw !
After acknowled@@ ging that he had been blind@@ ed by a ‘ ra@@ f@@ ter ’ of pride and that his critical att@@ itude was his problem , he began to change quickly for the better .
He started to attend Christian meetings regularly , to study God@@ ’@@ s Word ear@@ n@@ est@@ ly , and to make daily prayer a ha@@ bit .
‘ I@@ ’@@ ve known the truth for years , ’ he said , ‘ and I@@ ’@@ ve even served as a pi@@ one@@ er .
The apost@@ le Peter wrote : “ Sh@@ epher@@ d the flock of God under your care , serving as over@@ se@@ ers , not under comp@@ ul@@ sion , but will@@ ingly before God ; not for love of dis@@ honest gain , but ea@@ ger@@ ly ; not l@@ ording it over those who are God@@ ’@@ s inheritance , but becoming examples to the flock . ”
How can parents raise their children in the discipline of Jehovah ?

( b ) How did one family benefit from the parents ’ obedi@@ ence to Jehovah ?
Some years later , the daughter was re@@ inst@@ ated .
( b ) How can we make the elders ’ work more pleas@@ ant for them ?
They did not ber@@ ate me or crit@@ ic@@ ize me , but they encouraged me and strength@@ ened me .
After every congregation meeting , no matter how bus@@ y they were , at least one of them would ask how I was .
Because of my past , I found it difficult to feel worthy of God@@ ’@@ s love .
Time and time again , how@@ ever , Jehovah has used the congregation and the elders to confir@@ m his love for me .
I pray that I will never let him go . ”
If you turn to doing good , will you not be restored to favor ?
But if you do not turn to doing good , sin is c@@ rou@@ ching at the door , and its cra@@ ving is to domin@@ ate you ; but will you get the mast@@ ery over it ? ”
So let us “ listen to discipline and become wise . ”
People around the world are dem@@ and@@ ing more freedom .

To enjoy the ‘ good , ’ hum@@ ank@@ ind must trust God and obey him .
If they dis@@ obey , they will be left to decide for themselves what is good . . . and what is not good . ”
Like that pil@@ ot , Adam and E@@ ve wanted to do things their own way .
He said : “ If you remain in my word , you are really my disciples , and you will know the truth , and the truth will set you free . ”
Why can the freedom that Jesus promised make us “ truly free ” ?

The town of Li@@ ber@@ ty was surrounded by small farm@@ s , and the basic crop was cor@@ n .
She took us to the Bap@@ tist church every Sunday .
They wanted me to make the military my career .
This time , how@@ ever , they invited me to come to a Con@@ gre@@ gation Book Stud@@ y , a small meeting for Bible study and discussion that was held in their home .
I told them I would think about it .
Y@@ ears before , when I asked my mother about Jehov@@ ah@@ ’@@ s Witnesses , she simply said , “ Oh , they worship some old man named Jehovah . ”
But I now felt that my eyes were being opened !
I started pi@@ one@@ ering the next year , in 195@@ 8 .
Gl@@ or@@ ia was a je@@ we@@ l then , and she is a je@@ we@@ l today .
Gl@@ or@@ ia and I got married in February of 195@@ 9 .
A dear brother , Simon K@@ ra@@ ker , inter@@ view@@ ed us .
He told us that Bethel was not accep@@ ting married cou@@ ples at that time .
Most of our jobs paid three dol@@ lar@@ s a day .
Each week , Gl@@ or@@ ia did ir@@ oning for one family .
I remember one time when we stopped at a gas station .
On the other hand , we had wonderful times with the brothers , and we loved our minist@@ ry !
Mean@@ while , I started a study with the cou@@ pl@@ e@@ ’@@ s daughter and her husband .
Mother and daughter both decided to serve Jehovah and got baptized .
We had dear friends in the white congregation .
The K@@ u K@@ lu@@ x K@@ l@@ an ( K@@ K@@ K ) , an organization that promo@@ tes rac@@ ism and violence , was very active then .
In 196@@ 2 , I was invited to attend the Kingdom Ministry School at South L@@ ans@@ ing , New York .
How@@ ever , a tel@@ ephone company in P@@ ine Bl@@ u@@ ff had inter@@ view@@ ed me for a job .
If they hired me , I would be the first black man to work for that company .
I had no money to travel to New York .
She said , “ Go to school and learn as much as you can , and come back and teach us ! ”
Here is how Gl@@ or@@ ia re@@ members our time in P@@ ine Bl@@ u@@ ff : “ I fell in love with the territory !
So we would go in the house - to - house work in the morning and then conduct Bible studies the rest of the day , sometimes until 11 o@@ ’@@ clo@@ ck at night .
Bro@@ ther Le@@ on W@@ ea@@ ver , now the co@@ ordin@@ ator of the United States B@@ ran@@ ch Committee , was appointed to serve as a cir@@ cu@@ it over@@ se@@ er at the same time .
I was ner@@ v@@ ous about becoming a cir@@ cu@@ it over@@ se@@ er .
After I was appointed , Bro@@ ther Thom@@ p@@ son was the first district over@@ se@@ er I served with .
In those days , a cir@@ cu@@ it over@@ se@@ er received little training .
I remember saying to Gl@@ or@@ ia , “ Does he really have to leave now ? ”
One time , the K@@ K@@ K held a mar@@ ch in a town we were vis@@ iting in T@@ en@@ nes@@ see .
The following month , we began our Bethel service .
Gl@@ or@@ ia was a je@@ we@@ l when I married her , and she still is

What three questions will we consider , and why ?
Read John 15 : 1 - 5 , 8 .
Read Luke 8 : 5 - 8 , 11 - 15 .
How do we “ bear fruit with end@@ ur@@ ance ” ?
For I bear them witness that they have a z@@ eal for God , but not according to accur@@ ate knowledge . ”
When we returned , pas@@ ser@@ s@@ by asked , ‘ What happened ?
Why are you determined to “ bear fruit with end@@ ur@@ ance ” ?
“ My Father is glori@@ fied in this , that you keep bearing much fruit and prove yourselves my disciples . ” ​ — J@@ O@@ H@@ N 15 : 8 .
( Read John 15 : 1 , 8 . )
Jesus told his apostles : “ My Father is glori@@ fied in this , that you keep bearing much fruit . ”

We can be sure that Jehovah answers our prayers for help ( See paragraph 18 )
The apost@@ le Peter describes Satan the D@@ evil as “ a ro@@ ar@@ ing lion , ” and John calls him a “ serp@@ ent ” and a “ drag@@ on . ”
Those who believe this lie spend their lives serving “ R@@ ich@@ es ” rather than God .
We need to know our enemy , but we do not need to be terrified by him .
If we oppose him , he will flee from us .
