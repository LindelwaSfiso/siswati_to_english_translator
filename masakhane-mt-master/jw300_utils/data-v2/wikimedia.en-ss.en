Shaka kaSenzangakhona (circa 1787 – 22 September 1828), also known as Shaka[lower-alpha 1] Zulu (Zulu pronunciation: [ˈʃaːɠa]), was one of the most influential monarchs of the Zulu Kingdom. 
The successor to Senzangakhona 
When Senzangakhona (Shaka's father) died in 1816 Shaka's younger half-brother Sigujana assumed power as the legitimate heir to the Zulu chiefdom. 
Sigujana's reign was short however as Shaka, with the help of Dingiswayo and his half brother Ngwadi, had Sigujana assassinated[clarification needed] in a coup that was relatively bloodless and accepted by the Zulu. 
Thus Shaka became Chief of the Zulu clan, although he remained a vassal of the Mthethwa empire[5] until Dingiswayo's death in battle a year later at the hands of Zwide, powerful chief of the Ndwandwe (Nxumalo) nation. 
When the Mthethwa forces were defeated and scattered temporarily, the power vacuum was filled by Shaka. 
He reformed the remnants of the Mthwethwe and other regional tribes and later defeated Zwide in the Zulu Civil War of 1819-20. 
Mbandzeni (also known as Dlamini IV, Umbandine,[1] Umbandeen[2] ) (1855–1889) was the King of Swaziland from 1875 until 1889. 
Ingwenyama Mbandzeni was the son of Mswati II and Nandzi Nkambule.[3][4] His mother the wife of King Mswati had died when he was still very young. 
Mbandzeni ascended to the throne after his half brother Ludvonga II died before he could become the king.[3] Ludvonga's death resulted in his mother inkhosikati Lamgangeni adopting Mbandzeni who was motherless as her son, thus making him King and her the Queen mother of Swaziland.[3] His royal capital was at Mbekelweni. 
During his kingship Mbandzeni, granted many mining, farming, trading and administrative concessions to white settlers from Britain and the Transvaal. These concessions granted with the help of Offy sherpstone eventually led to the conventions of 1884 and 1894, which reduced the overall borders of Swaziland and later made Swaziland a protectorate of the South African Republic. 
Mbandzeni, still in command of a large Swazi army of more than 15000 men aided the British in defeating Sekhukhune in 1879 and preventing Zulu incursion into the Transvaal during the same year.[5] As a result, he guaranteed his country's independence and international recognition despite the Scramble for Africa which was taking place at the time. 
Mbandzeni died after an illness in 1889 and is quoted to have said in his deathbed "the Swazi kingship dies with me".[6] [7] He was buried at the royal cemetery at Mbilaneni alongside his father and grandfather Sobhuza I. Mbandzeni was succeeded by his young son Mahlokohla and his wife Queen Labotsibeni Mdluli after a 5 year regency of Queen Tibati Nkambule.[6] Today a number of buildings and roads in Swaziland are named after Mbandzeni. Among these the Mbandzeni house in Mbabane and the Mbandzeni Highway to Siteki are named after him.[8] 
The Makhonjwa Mountains, also known as the Barberton Greenstone Belt or Barberton Mountain Land, is a range of small mountains and hills that covers an area of 120 by 60 kilometres (75 by 37 mi), about 80% in Mpumalanga, a province of South Africa, and the remainder in neighbouring Swaziland.[1]

The Makhonjwa Mountains, also known as the Barberton Greenstone Belt or Barberton Mountain Land, is a range of small mountains and hills that covers an area of 120 by 60 kilometres (75 by 37 mi), about 80% in Mpumalanga, a province of South Africa, and the remainder in neighbouring Swaziland.[1] 
The area ranges in altitude from 600 to 1,800 metres (2,000 to 5,900 ft) above mean sea level. It has a number of rocky hills, with moist grassy uplands and forested valleys.[1] The region lies within the Barberton Centre of Endemism.[2] The mean annual precipitation is 600–1,150 millimetres (24–45 in), with wet summers and dry winters.[2] 
The mountains lie on the eastern edge of the Kaapvaal Craton. The range is best known for having some of the oldest exposed rocks on Earth, estimated to be between 3.2 and 3.6 billion years (Ga) old, dating from the Paleoarchean.[1] The mountain range's extreme age and exceptional preservation have yielded some of the oldest undisputed signs of life on Earth and provide insight into the hostile nature of the Precambrian environment under which this life evolved.[3][4] This has led to the area being otherwise known as the "Genesis of life".[5] 
The range is also known for its gold deposits and a number of komatiites, an unusual type of ultramafic volcanic rock named after the Komati River[6] that flows through the belt.

The Komati River (also called Incomati River) is a river in South Africa, Swaziland and Mozambique. 
It is 480 kilometres (298 mi) long, with a drainage basin 50,000 square kilometres (19,300 sq mi) in size. 
Its mean annual discharge is 111 m3/s (3,920 cfs) at its mouth.[1] The name Komati is derived from inkomati (siSwati), meaning "cow", as its perennial nature is compared to a cow that always has milk.[2] 
The river originates west of Carolina, rising at an elevation of about 1,800 m (5,906 ft) near Breyten in the Ermelo district of the Mpumalanga province.[3] It flows in a general northeasterly direction and reaches the Indian Ocean at Maputo Bay, after a course of some 480 km (298 mi). 
The Komati Gorge is situated in the upper reaches of the Komati River and is the habitat of some endangered species such as the southern bald ibis.[4] In 2001 the 115 m high wall of the Maguga Dam was completed south of Piggs Peak, Swaziland, 26°4′51.57″S 31°15′25.84″E﻿ / ﻿26.0809917°S 31.2571778°E﻿ / -26.0809917; 31.2571778. 
In its upper valley near Steynsdorp are goldfields, but the reefs consist almost entirely of low grade ore. 
The river descends the Drakensberg by a pass 48 km (30 mi) south of Barberton, and is deflected northward at the eastern border of Swaziland, keeping a course parallel to the Lebombo mountains. 
Just west of 32°E and 25°25'S, near the town of Komatipoort, it is joined by the Crocodile River. 
The Crocodile tributary rises, as the Elands River, in the Bergendal (1,961 m) near the upper waters of the Komati, and flows eastwards across the highveld, being turned northward as it reaches the Drakensberg escarpment. 
The fall to the lowveld is over 600 m in 48 km (30 mi), and across the 161 km (100 mi) wide country between the Drakensberg and the Lebombo there is a further fall of 900 m. 
Just over a kilometre below the junction of the Crocodile, the united stream, which from this point is also known as the Manhissa, passes to the coastal plain through a 190 m high cleft, high in the Lebombo known as Komatipoort, featuring some picturesque falls. 
At Komatipoort, which marks the border between South Africa and Mozambique, the river is less than 100 km (60 mi) from its mouth in a direct line, but in crossing the plain it makes a wide sweep of 322 km (200 mi), first northwards before turning southwards, forming lagoon-like expanses and backwaters and receiving from the north several tributaries. 
In flood time there is a connection northward through the swamps with the basin of the Limpopo. 
The Komati enters the sea 24 km (15 mi) north of Maputo. 
It is navigable from its mouth, where the water is up to 5m deep, to the foot of the Lebombo. 
The Portuguese named the river's lower reaches the Rio des Reijs, or "river of rice". Subsequently Jan van Riebeeck's journal mentions a Rio de Reijs, when he dispatched a ship up the east coast in search of rice supplies.[5] In voortrekker Louis Tregardt's journal it is referred to as the Manhissa,[6] a name still extant, while to the British it was known as the King George River.[7] 
In 1725 a Dutch expedition led by Francois de Kuiper explored the region of the lower Komati and travelled 30km into the current Mpumalanga province, before they were attacked by local tribes and had to return to Delagoa Bay. 
On the September 23, 1900 during the Second Boer War, 3,000 Boers crossed the frontier at the small town of Komati Poort, and surrendered to the Portuguese authorities. 
On November 7, 1900 the banks of the Komati became the site of a battle between the British Empire and the Boers. 
The Battle of Leliefontein was a retreat by the British, harassed by the Boers, who were threatening to capture the British Artillery. 
The British guns were saved by the Royal Canadian Dragoons who charged the Boers, whereby they placed the guns out of their reach. 
The railway from Maputo to Pretoria traverses the plain in a direct line, and at seventy-two kilometres, reaches the Komati. It follows the south bank of the river and enters the high country at Komati Poort. 
From the Poort westward the railway skirts the south bank of the Crocodile River throughout its length. This railway was originally constructed by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM) and was officially inaugurated in 1895.

General area 
Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve (or Motlatse Canyon Provincial Nature Reserve) is situated in the Drakensberg escarpment region of eastern Mpumalanga, South Africa. 
The reserve protects the Blyde River Canyon, including sections of the Ohrigstad and Blyde Rivers and the geological formations around Bourke's Luck Potholes, where the Treur River tumbles into the Blyde below. 
Southwards of the canyon, the reserve follows the escarpment, to include the Devil's and God's Window, the latter a popular viewpoint to the lowveld at the reserve's southern extremity. 
The Mogologolo (1,794 m), Mariepskop (1,944 m) and Hebronberg (1,767 m) massifs are partially included in the reserve. 
Elevation varies from 560 m to 1,944 m above sea level.[1] Its resort areas are F.H. Odendaal and Swadeni, the latter only accessible from Limpopo province. 
The area of approximately 29,000 hectares (290 km2) is administered by the Mpumalanga Parks Board.[1] 
This geological feature and day visitors' attraction, is situated at the confluence of the Treur and Blyde Rivers, on the reserve's western boundary 24°40′28″S 30°48′39″E﻿ / ﻿24.67444°S 30.81083°E﻿ / -24.67444; 30.81083﻿ (Bourke's Luck Potholes). 
The reserve's nature conservation headquarters is located here, beside the village of Moremela, at the canyon's southern, or upper reaches. 
Sustained kolks in the Treur River's plunge pools have eroded a number of cylindrical potholes or giant's kettles, which can be viewed from the crags above. 
It was named after a local prospector, Tom Bourke, who predicted the presence of gold, though he found none himself. 
The pedestrian bridges connect the various overlooks of the potholes and the gorge downstream. 
The Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. 
They resemble the traditional round or oval rondavels or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the N1 road in the Northern Cape, very far to the south.[2] 
The names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. 
The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, "the chief", who is remembered for opposing invading Swazis in a memorable battle. 
The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives – Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. 
Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of Mariepskop may be visible. 
Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the "sundial" or “mountain with a shadow that moves". 
It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day.[3] 
On a clear day the lookout point provides a spectacular view. 
From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern Drakensberg range. 
It presents a view that is overwhelmingly beautiful and deserves more than a moment's respite.[2] 
The formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels at which we marvel. 
Whatever their origin, they are undoubtedly breathtaking, and together with God's Window and Bourkes Luck Potholes, the Three Rondavels are a highlight of a trip to the third largest canyon in the world. 
A southward view from God's Window towards Kowyn Pass 
God’s Window 24°52′28″S 30°53′29″E﻿ / ﻿24.87444°S 30.89139°E﻿ / -24.87444; 30.89139﻿ (God's Window) is a popular vantage point along the Drakensberg escarpment, at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve. 
Here, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the lowveld. 
From this escarpment—a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs—opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the Eden-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. 
On a clear day it is possible to see over the Kruger National Park towards the Lebombo Mountains on the border with Mozambique. 
God’s Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 cult film The Gods Must Be Crazy. 
Near the end of the movie, the Bushman character Xi (played by Namibian bush farmer N!xau) travels to God’s Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth. 
The original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment. 
A viewing platform 24°52′35.8″S 30°53′19.6″E﻿ / ﻿24.876611°S 30.888778°E﻿ / -24.876611; 30.888778﻿ (God's Window viewing platform) near the car park gives a spectacular view down the gorge to the plain below. 
The high plateaus are inhabited by mountain reedbuck, baboon troops and rock hyraxes. 
Hippo and crocodile are present in the Blyderivierpoort Dam. 
Impala, kudu, blue wildebeest, waterbuck and zebra roam the wooded lowveld area. 
Exotic fish like smallmouth bass, brown and rainbow trout occur in the river, which have reduced the range of the local Treur river barb to upper catchments of the Blyde River system.[4] Thanks to reintroductions after its rediscovery in the 1970s, it now flourishes here.[5] The Natal mountain catfish occurs as an isolated population in the Limpopo system, and the Belvedere creek is the only place in the Limpopo system where the Rosefin barb is found.[5] 
African fish eagle and African finfoot are found along the Blyde River. 
The lowveld woodlands harbour purple-crested lourie, emerald cuckoo, red-backed mannikin, golden-tailed woodpecker, gorgeous bushshrike, white-faced owl and a number of raptors like white-backed vulture, gymnogene, black-chested snake eagle, Wahlberg's eagle and long-crested eagle. 
A number of raptors frequent the mountains and cliffs, including cape vulture, black eagle, jackal buzzard, peregrine falcon, lanner falcon and rock kestrel. 
Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve 
Birds associated with flowering plants of the higher slopes include Gurney's sugarbird and malachite sunbird. 
A breeding colony of bald ibis occurs in the grassy uplands, besides small numbers of cape eagle-owl and red-breasted sparrowhawk. 
Forest birds include crowned eagle, Knysna lourie, cinnamon dove, olive bushshrike, green twinspot and wood owl. 
The reserve's vegetation is classified as the Northeastern Drakensberg High-Mountain Sourveld ecoregion, an area prone to lightning-induced burning. 
Its very diverse flora is ascribed to the variation in altitude and rainfall (541 mm to 2,776 mm p.a.), and the extremes in geology and pedology.[1] It is topographically complex with a variety of habitats which include grassland plateaus, wetlands and sponge areas, grassland slopes, afromontane forest, riparian forest, moist woodlands, dry woodlands and shrublands. 
Its four veld types are Afromontane Forest, North-eastern Mountain Sour Grassland, Sour Lowveld Bushveld and Mixed Lowveld Bushveld.[1] 
Around a 1,000 plant species have been recorded. 
This includes cycads, of which the Blyde river cycad is almost endemic to the reserve, with some 200 individuals remaining.[7] A variety of orchid, lily and protea (genera Protea and Faurea) species occur. 
Tree ferns grow along seepages in the uplands. 
Indigenous forest covers 2,111 ha of the nature reserve, or 7.3% of its surface area. These are fragmented into some 60 patches between 0.21 ha and 567 ha in extent. 
They are assigned to two forest communities, high altitude moist and low altitude dry afromontane forest. The altitudinal gradient accounts for most of their variation in plant communities.[1] 
The reserve is fringed to the east by the Mariepskop and Klaserie Waterfall Nature Reserves, and the Mapulaneng forestry region, below the escarpment. 
National Park status had been considered, if some adjacent areas were to be incorporated and their forestry activities discontinued. 
Percy Fitzpatrick and George Fullerton's summer quarters as transport riders during the 1880s was situated at Paradise Camp 24°55′24″S 30°52′08″E﻿ / ﻿24.92333°S 30.86889°E﻿ / -24.92333; 30.86889﻿ (Paradise Camp), some 6 km south of God's Window, and similarly perched on the edge of the escarpment. 
Close to God's Window are several waterfalls, including Berlin Falls and Lisbon Falls.[8]

The Crocodile River (Afrikaans: Krokodilrivier) is a river in South Africa. 
After its confluence with the Marico River, both rivers form the Limpopo River.[1] 
NASA picture of the Crocodile River south of Thabazimbi 
The Crocodile River has its source in the Witwatersrand mountain range, originating in Constantia Kloof, Roodepoort, Gauteng province. The first dam it fills is the Lake Heritage Dam just west of the Lanseria Airport. 
Just north of this airport is its confluence with the Jukskei River. 
Further downstream into the North West two large dams are located in the river, namely Hartbeespoort Dam[2] and Roodekoppies Dam. 
Beyond the Hartbeespoort Dam, it passes the town of Brits. 
The Elands River joins downstream from the Vaalkop Dam, about 20 km further the Pienaars River joins its right bank, shortly after exiting the Klipvoor Dam. 
In the Limpopo Province, about 35 km further, the Crocodile River passes the town of Thabazimbi and meanders for many miles through a sparsely inhabited area before joining the Marico River just west of Rooibokkraal at the limit of North West Province to form the start of the Limpopo River.[3] 
The tributaries of the Crocodile River include the Bloubankspruit, Hennops River, Jukskei River, Magalies River, Sterkstroom River, Rosespruit, Skeerpoort River, Kareespruit, Elands River, Bierspruit River and Sundays River.[4] 
The Crocodile River is one of the most pressured river systems in South Africa. 
The effects of pollution from two of South Africa's largest cities, Johannesburg and Tshwane, has been detrimental to the ecology of the system. Untreated industrial, mining, agricultural and household waste has deteriorated the water quality throughout most of its course and led to massive algal blooms in the Hartbeespoort Dam and Roodekoppies Dam. Invasive plant species have negatively affected the integrity of the system. 
Unsustainable farming practices have led to sediment overloads and erosion further harming the river.

Origin of the name 
Kaapsehoop or Kaapschehoop is a town in the Mpumalanga province (formerly Eastern Transvaal) of South Africa. 
It is situated 1486 m (4878 ft.) above sea level on the Highveld escarpment, about 25 km from Nelspruit, the capital of Mpumalanga. 
The name of the town is no doubt derived from the fact that when gold was discovered in the town, the find created hope for the early inhabitants of the geographically nearby De Kaap Valley – The Cape Valley – of attaining great wealth. 
Kaapsehoop is set out between large natural clearings in the rock fields near the top of the escarpment overlooking the lush De Kaap Valley situated some 800 metres below, with distant views towards Barberton and Nelspruit. 
Kaapsehoop originally gained fame as a gold mining town once known as the Duiwels Kantoor – the Devil's Office – towards the end of the 19th century, when gold was discovered in 1882 in a small creek running through the town. 
This led to portion of the original township layout being canceled and opened up for gold diggings. However, the earlier better paying discoveries of gold at both Pilgrim's Rest in 1873 and Barberton in 1881, followed by the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886 (later to become the town of Johannesburg), coupled with the meager returns obtained at Kaapsche Hoop led to the town going into decline. 
The town has been "re-discovered" in recent time and has now become a popular weekend retreat with its period housing including accommodation establishments. New housing (some not period) has also been established on some of the remaining vacant stands (erven). 
The town is also within commuting distance of the centre of Nelspruit situated some 30 odd kilometres away. 
The rock field formations near the town are made up of quartzites of the Black Reef Formation of the Transvaal Supergroup. 
Kaapsche Hoop is the original High Dutch spelling of Kaapsehoop as now spelt in Afrikaans. The name of the town was no doubt derived from the fact that gold was discovered in the town which sits high above the De Kaap Valley – The Cape Valley – and the find then created the hope for the early inhabitants of the nearby De Kaap Valley area of attaining great wealth. 
High Dutch was the official language of the two original Boer Republics of the Orange Free State or Oranje-Vrijstaat and the South African Republic or Suid Afrikaanse Republiek or Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (ZAR). 
High Dutch was eventually to be replaced by Afrikaans a colloquially spoken language of many of the European descended settlers. Afrikaans was largely derived from Dutch and incorporating words derived or adopted from French, German, English and indigenous African languages.

The Maputo River (Portuguese Rio Maputo), also called Great Usutu River, Lusutfu River, or Suthu River, is a river in South Africa, Swaziland, and Mozambique. 
The name Suthu refers to Basotho people who lived near the source of the river, but were attacked and displaced by Swazis.[1] It is also said to mean 'dark brown', a description of the river's muddy water.[2] 
The river rises near Amsterdam, Mpumalanga, South Africa, and flows easterly through Swaziland, where it enters the Lebombo Mountains. 
The 13 km gorge forms the boundary between Swaziland and South Africa. 
For approximately twenty kilometres, it forms the border between South Africa (province of KwaZulu-Natal) and Mozambique. 
There, in the Ndumo Game Reserve, it absorbs its largest tributary, the Pongola River. 
It then meanders through the Mozambican coastal plain and empties into southern Maputo Bay, some 85 kilometres downstream. 
In Swaziland, the river is called the Great Usutu or Lusutfu and flows through the towns of Bhunya, Luyengo, Siphofaneni, and Big Bend. 
The town of Big Bend is near a point in which the river meanders abruptly. 
The Great Usutu is the largest river in Swaziland, is the site of Swaziland's lowest point (21 m above sea level), and is known for whitewater rafting. 
No large towns have been able to form along its banks because of deep narrow valleys and dense forests. 
It is, however, home to some golf courses, hotels, and nature reserves. 
From the origin to its mouth, in order, tributaries are the: Seganagana, Bonnie Brook, Mpuluzi, Buhlungu, Umvenvane, Lusushwana, Sidvokodvo, Mkhondvo, Mhlamani, Mzimneni, Mzimphofu, Mhlathuzane, Mtsindzekwa, Nyetane, Funuane, and the Pongola Rivers.[3]

Kosi Bay border post in the southern part of the border 
The border between Mozambique and South Africa is divided into two segments, separated by the kingdom of Swaziland. 
The northern segment, which is 410 kilometres (255 mi) long,[1] runs north-south along the Lebombo Mountains from Zimbabwe to Swaziland. 
The southern segment, which is 81 kilometres (50 mi) long,[1] runs east-west across Maputaland from Swaziland to the Indian Ocean. 
The tripoint with Zimbabwe is located at Crooks' Corner, in the Limpopo River either at or very close to its confluence with the Luvuvhu River.[2] The border runs in a straight line from this tripoint to the Shingwedzi River, and then along a series of straight lines joining beacons generally along the top of the eastern slope of the Lebombo Mountains.[1] It crosses the Olifants, Sabie and Komati rivers. 
This segment of the border terminates at the northern Swaziland tripoint at Mpundweni Beacon near Namaacha. 
The southern Swaziland tripoint is situated at Abercorn Drift in the Usutu River (Maputo River), where the Mozambique–Swaziland border along the Lebombo Mountains meets the river. 
From here the border follows the Usuthu to its former confluence with the Pongola River; the location of the confluence has changed since the border was demarcated.[1] The border then runs in an easterly direction along straight lines joining beacons generally at the same latitude as the Usutu-Pongola confluence (approximately 26° 52′ South).[1] It meets the Indian Ocean below Monte Ouro peak, just to the south of Ponta do Ouro. 
There are four official border crossings, three in the northern segment and one in the southern segment. 
The main crossing is Ressano Garcia/Lebombo where the Maputo Corridor highway and railway cross the border. The crossings are listed from north to south in the table below.[3]

Background 
The Bisho massacre occurred on 7 September 1992 in Bisho, in the then nominally independent homeland of Ciskei which is now part of the Eastern Cape in South Africa. 
Twenty-eight African National Congress supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march when they attempted to enter Bisho (now renamed to Bhisho) to demand the reincorporation of Ciskei into South Africa during the final years of apartheid. 
Bhisho (previously spelled Bisho) was the capital of the Ciskei, a nominally independent homeland (bantustan) for the Xhosa people in South Africa. The government of Ciskei was formed in 1961 under the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951 after the South African government declared it a separate administrative territory. In 1972, the status was elevated to self-governing territory.

The Constitution of South Africa is the supreme law of the Republic of South Africa. 
It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the republic, sets out the rights and duties of its citizens, and defines the structure of the government. 
The current constitution, the country's fifth, was drawn up by the Parliament elected in 1994 in the South African general election, 1994. 
It was promulgated by President Nelson Mandela on 18th December 1996 and came into effect on 4 February 1997, replacing the Interim Constitution of 1993.[1] 
Since 1996, the Constitution has been amended by seventeen amendment acts. The Constitution is formally entitled the "Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996." 
It was previously also numbered as if it were an Act of Parliament—Act No. 108 of 1996—but, since the passage of the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act,[2] neither it nor the acts amending it are allocated act numbers. 
An integral part of the negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa was the creation of a new constitution. One of the major disputed issues was the process by which such a constitution would be adopted. 
Formal negotiations began in December 1991 at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). The parties agreed on a process whereby a negotiated transitional constitution would provide for an elected constitutional assembly to draw up a permanent constitution.[3] The CODESA negotiations broke down, however, after the second plenary session in May 1992. 
One of the major points of dispute was the size of the supermajority that would be required for the assembly to adopt the constitution: The NP wanted a 75 per cent requirement,[4] which would effectively have given it a veto.[3] 
It is located at an elevation of 51 meters above sea level. Umgababa River is also known as Umgababa, Umtateni River. The name is derived from an ancient Zulu Chief Luthuli who used to live in the valley. 
The Chief of uMgababa is Phathisizwe Philbert Luthuli. Litchis are produced in this region. There once was a large titanium mine here but it closed due to serious sea pollution. 
In a few years it has grown from a rural area into a semi-vacation place. A number of people are moving to the lovely place to enjoy the true beauty of nature. The area now hosts the biggest annual year-end event consisting of many popular South African musicians on New Year's Eve.

Matamela Cyril Ramaphosa (born 17 November 1952) is a South African politician and the fifth President of South Africa. His tenure as President follows the resignation of Jacob Zuma. 
Previously an anti-apartheid activist, trade union leader, and businessman, he served as the Deputy President of South Africa from 2014 to 2018. He was elected President of the African National Congress (ANC) at the ANC National Conference in Nasrec, South of Johannesburg in December 2017. He is also the former Chairman of the National Planning Commission,[1] which is responsible for strategic planning for the future of the country, with the goal of rallying South Africa "around a common set of objectives and priorities to drive development over the longer term".[2] 
He has been called a skillful negotiator[3] and strategist[4] who acted as the ANC's Chief Negotiator during South Africa's transition to democracy.[5] Ramaphosa built up the biggest and most powerful trade union in the country – the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).[6] He played a crucial role, with Roelf Meyer of the National Party, during the negotiations to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid and steer the country towards its first fully democratic elections in April 1994.[7] Ramaphosa was Nelson Mandela's choice for future president.[8] Ramaphosa is well known as a businessman, and his estimated net worth is over R6.4 billion ($550 million) as of 2018,[9] with 31 properties[10] and previously-held notable ownership in companies such as McDonald's South Africa, chair of the board for MTN and member of the board for Lonmin. 
Ramaphosa was born in Soweto, Johannesburg, on 17 November 1952,[21][22] the second of the three children to Erdmuth and retired policeman Samuel Ramaphosa.[23] He attended Tshilidzi Primary School and Sekano Ntoane High School in Soweto.[24] In 1971, he matriculated from Mphaphuli High School in Sibasa, Venda where he was elected head of the Student Christian Movement.[25] He subsequently registered to study law at the University of the North (Turfloop) in Limpopo Province in 1972.[26] 
While at university, Ramaphosa became involved in student politics and joined the South African Students Organisation (SASO)[27] and the Black People's Convention (BPC).[28] This resulted in him being detained in solitary confinement for eleven months in 1974 under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act, 1967, for organising pro-Frelimo rallies.[29] In 1976 he was detained again, following the unrest in Soweto, and held for six months at John Vorster Square under the Terrorism Act.[29] After his release, he became a law clerk for a Johannesburg firm of attorneys and continued with his legal studies through correspondence with the University of South Africa (UNISA), where he obtained his B. Proc. 
Uses 
Skin whitening[notes 1] is the practice of using substances, mixtures, or physical treatments to lighten skin color. 
Skin whitening treatments work by reducing the content of melanin of the skin. 
Many agents have been shown to be effective in skin whitening; some have beneficial side effects (e.g.: are antioxidants,[1] nutrients, or decrease the risk of some types of cancer); some are a significant risk to health (for example, those containing mercury).

Skin whitening 
Langalibalele (isiHlubi: The sun is boiling hot), also known as Mtetwa (c1814 – 1889), was king of the amaHlubi, a Bantu tribe in what is the modern-day province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. 
He was born on the eve of the arrival of European settlers in the province. 
After conflict with the Zulu king Mpande, he fled with his people to the Colony of Natal in 1848. 
During the diamond rush of the 1870s, many of his young men worked on the mines in Kimberley where they acquired guns. 
In 1873 the colonial authorities of Natal demanded that the guns be registered, Langalibalele refused and a stand-off ensued, resulting in a violent skirmish in which European troopers were killed. 
Langalibalele fled across the mountains into Basutoland, but was captured, tried and banished to Robben Island. 
He eventually returned to his home, but remained under house arrest. 
Patrice Émery Lumumba (/lʊˈmʊmbə/;[4] alternatively styled Patrice Hemery Lumumba;[2] 2 July 1925 – 17 January 1961) was a Congolese politician and independence leader who served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo (then Republic of the Congo) from June until September 1960. 
He played a significant role in the transformation of the Congo from a colony of Belgium into an independent republic. 
Ideologically an African nationalist and Pan-Africanist, he led the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) party from 1958 until his assassination. 
Sara Baartman (Afrikaans: [ˈsɑːrɐ ˈbɑːrtman]; also spelled Sarah, sometimes in the diminutive form Saartje ([ˈsɑːrtʃi]), or Saartjie and Bartman, Bartmann; 1770s – 29 December 1815)[1]:184 was the most well known of at least two[2] South African Khoikhoi women who, due to their large buttocks, were exhibited as freak show attractions in 19th-century Europe under the name Hottentot Venus—"Hottentot" was the name for the Khoi people, now considered an offensive term,[3] and "Venus" referred to the Roman goddess of love. 
Life 
Early on, her treatment on the Piccadilly stage caught the attention of British abolitionists, who argued that her performance was indecent and that she was being forced to perform against her will. Ultimately, the court ruled in favour of her exhibition after Dunlop produced a contract made between himself and Baartman. It is doubtful that this contract was valid: it was probably produced for the purposes of the trial.[1][2] Cesars left the show and Dunlop continued to display Baartman in country fairs. 
In 1814, after Dunlop's death, a man called Henry Taylor brought Baartman to Paris. He sold her to an animal trainer, S. Reaux, who made her amuse onlookers who frequented the Palais-Royal. Georges Cuvier, founder and professor of comparative anatomy at the Museum of Natural History, examined Baartman as he searched for proof of a so-called missing link between animals and human beings.

Chewa (/ˈtʃɛwə/), also known as Nyanja (/ˈnjændʒə/), is a language of the Bantu language family. The noun class prefix chi- is used for languages,[4] so the language is usually called Chichewa and Chinyanja (spelled Cinianja in Mozambique). 
In Malawi, the name was officially changed from Chinyanja to Chichewa in 1968 at the insistence of President Hastings Kamuzu Banda (himself of the Chewa people), and this is still the name most commonly used in Malawi today.[5] In Zambia, the language is generally known as Nyanja or Cinyanja/Chinyanja '(language) of the lake' (referring to Lake Malawi).[6] 
The whole Bible was translated into the Likoma Island dialect of Nyanja by William Percival Johnson and published as Chikalakala choyera: ndicho Malangano ya Kale ndi Malangano ya Chapano in 1912.[17] Another Bible translation, known as the Buku Lopatulika ndilo Mau a Mulungu, was made in a more standard Central Region dialect about 1900-1922 by missionaries of the Dutch Reformed Mission and Church of Scotland with the help of some Malawians.

Early years 
The hearing took place on 9 February 2016.[28] At it, Zuma's counsel, Jeremy Gauntlett SC, made a series of major concessions, including that the Nkandla report was binding on Zuma, but asked the Court not to declare that Zuma had acted unconstitutionally.[28] The issue was significant because such a declaration would be a basis for Zuma's impeachment.[28] Zuma's strategy was perceived as an attempt to evade responsibility and throw his ministers under the bus.[28][29] Minister Nhleko's legal team, in turn, said his "hands were tied" because he was following instructions from Zuma and the National Assembly.[29] Only Speaker Baleka Mbete's counsel, Lindi Nkosi-Thomas SC, seriously disputed the EFF and DA's account of the facts and law, but was ultimately forced to capitulate and was widely mocked for her "bumbling" performance.[29][30] 
Judgment 
The Constitutional Court's unanimous judgment was delivered on 31 March 2016 by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.[31] It confirms the SCA's holding in SABC v DA that the Public Protector's recommendations are binding. 
It does this on the basis of a purposive interpretation of the South African Constitution; without the power to make binding recommendations, Mogoeng CJ holds, the Public Protector would be ineffectual: 
The predicament though is that mere allegations and investigation of improper or corrupt conduct against all, especially powerful public office-bearers, are generally bound to attract a very unfriendly response. 
An unfavourable finding of unethical or corrupt conduct coupled with remedial action, will probably be strongly resisted in an attempt to repair or soften the inescapable reputational damage. 
It is unlikely that unpleasant findings and a biting remedial action would be readily welcomed by those investigated. 
If compliance with remedial action taken were optional, then very few culprits, if any at all, would allow it to have any effect. 
And if it were, by design, never to have a binding effect, then it is incomprehensible just how the Public Protector could ever be effective in what she does and be able to contribute to the strengthening of our constitutional democracy. ” 
“ When remedial action is binding, compliance is not optional, whatever reservations the affected party might have about its fairness, appropriateness or lawfulness. 
For this reason, the remedial action taken against those under investigation cannot be ignored without any legal consequences. 
This is so, because our constitutional order hinges also on the rule of law. 
No decision grounded on the Constitution or law may be disregarded without recourse to a court of law. 
To do otherwise would "amount to a licence to self-help". 
Whether the Public Protector’s decisions amount to administrative action or not, the disregard for remedial action by those adversely affected by it, amounts to taking the law into their own hands and is illegal. 
No binding and constitutionally or statutorily sourced decision may be disregarded willy-nilly. 
It has legal consequences and must be complied with or acted upon. 
To achieve the opposite outcome lawfully, an order of court would have to be obtained. ” 
Since President Zuma ignored the report even without having them set aside, Mogoeng held he had breached the South African Constitution: 
The National Treasury — headed by Pravin Gordhan, who had recently locked horns with Zuma's administration[32][33] — was ordered, within 60 days, to determine the costs of the non-security upgrades at Nkandla, and the proportion thereof to be repaid by Zuma. 
Mogoeng's "powerful" and "profound" judgment was hailed as a "triumph for the rule of law", and a major blow to the widely criticised President, of whose conduct the judgment was "scathing".[34][35][36][37][38][39][40] One commentator said Mogoeng's judgment was "his moment of triumph and redemption", and marked his transformation from a supposed "tool" of the establishment to a "national hero" in a manner reminiscent of Earl Warren.[41] Political analyst Steven Friedman said the judgment was "the clearest message yet that the Constitution is working";[42] another commentator said the judgment's importance was that "it is a muscular assertion that all rule in this country is subject to the Constitution".[43] Former President Thabo Mbeki said the judges of the Constitutional Court should be "salute[d]" for "the meticulous manner in which they discharged their constitutional responsibilities as our apex court".[44] Justice Edwin Cameron, who sat in the case, suggested in a public address that it was one of the Court's two most significant ever judgments.[45] One commentator noted, however, that President Zuma's counsel had conceded most of the points the Court decided against him.[46] 
In the immediate wake of the judgment, Julius Malema and Mmusi Maimane, the leaders of the two victorious applicants in the case, called for Zuma to step down.[47][48][49] However, Zuma sought to downplay the judgment. 
In a press statement the following evening, he said he welcomed the judgment and had always accepted the Public Protector's reports were binding, and noted that the Court found he had been entitled to institute a parallel investigative process and had acted "honestly" and "in good faith".[50] Legal commentators condemned these claims as serious misrepresentations of the judgment.[51][52] They pointed out that it could not possibly have been the case, as Zuma claimed, that he was merely adopting the High Court's approach to the powers of the Public Protector in its DA v SABC judgment, because that was handed down six weeks after Zuma signaled his intention not to comply with her report.[7] Commentators also condemned the Presidency's statement[53][54] that the Court had never found Zuma breached his office, since that was the judgment's unmistakable implication.[55][56] 
The ANC Women's League had released a statement hours after the judgment saying its faith in Zuma "remains unshaken".[57][58] Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe, speaking on behalf of the so-called Top Six, said he "welcomed" Zuma's apologetic statement but that calls for his impeachment were "over-exaggerated".[59][60] Chief whip Jackson Mthembu and Deputy Minister of Justice John Jeffery took the view that, although Zuma had breached the Constitution, the breach was not "serious".[61][62] The impeachment bid by opposition MPs on 5 April 2016 failed by over 120 votes.[62] Some were surprised that even Zuma's opponents within the ANC like Cyril Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan had voted against the motion.[7][64] The Congress of the People, an opposition party, said it would boycott parliamentary proceedings in light of the National Assembly's failure to implement the Court's judgment.[65] 
Nevertheless, many analysts said the judgment might prove a fatal blow to Zuma, although factional battles within the ANC would be the ultimate decider.[1][66][67] One suggested that powerful ANC members had lost faith in Zuma and might move to oust him at a more opportune moment.[63] The South African Communist Party, part of Zuma's own tripartite alliance, had been skeptical about the adequacy of his response to the judgment.[68] Some ANC members booed Zuma at his next subsequent appearance.[69] And several prominent members of civil society and former ANC insiders, including Ahmed Kathrada, Ronnie Kasrils, Trevor Manuel, Cheryl Carolus, and retired Constitutional Court judge Zak Yacoob, called for Zuma's resignation,[70][71][72][73] prompting a backlash from certain Zuma allies.[74] The South African Council of Churches did the same, saying Zuma had "lost all moral authority".[75][76] The Gauteng ANC, led by noted Zuma critic Paul Mashatile, formally resolved that Zuma must resign;[77][78] doubts were raised about Zuma's leadership even within his traditional strongholds like the ANC's Limpopo branches;[79] and an internal ANC memorandum sent by party veterans to the Top Six allegedly demanded Zuma's recall and compared him to detested apartheid-era President P. W. Botha.[76] Finally, members of the Gupta family, thought to be Zuma's long-standing allies and crucial financial backers, resigned from their major holding company and fled South Africa for Dubai in the week after the judgment – leaving Zuma, in the opinion of some analysts, extremely vulnerable.[80][81] In the wake of these developments, Malema said it was now time to "crush the head of the snake".[82] On 12 April 2016, Max du Preez said the key question, "now that the balance of power has turned irrevocably against Zuma", was how to ensure he makes a managed — and non-violent — exit.[83] 
The report proved highly controversial, as Zuma and his ANC government refused to act on it and questioned its legitimacy.[5] On three occasions during 2014, the Presidency wrote letters to the Public Protector taking a skeptical attitude to the report.[2] On 14 August 2014 Zuma said he would allow Parliament, and the Minister of Police, to determine what remedial steps, if any, he should take.[6] He later denied that the Public Protector's recommendations were legally binding.[7] Zuma's evasiveness led to severe and widespread criticism, including by opposition parties the Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance. 
EFF MPs frequently interrupted parliamentary proceedings to demand that Zuma "pay back the money",[8][9] leading to confrontations between them and Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete, considered by some to be partial to Zuma in her management of parliamentary proceedings.[10][11][12] On one such occasion, at Zuma's 2015 State of the Nation address, these interruptions led to brawl between MPs and security personnel and a subsequent court action (which was decided against the government).[13][14] When Zuma appeared in Parliament he repeatedly ignored or laughed off questions about Nkandla.[15][16][17] Eventually the EFF announced, in May 2015, that it would file a court application to compel Zuma to act on the Public Protector's report.[18][19] The DA filed a similar application shortly thereafter.[20] 
As anticipated, the ANC-controlled National Assembly constituted an ad hoc committee to conduct a parallel investigative process led by Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko, whose report, released in August 2015, purported to "exonerate" Zuma.[21] This report was adopted by Parliament on 18 August 2015.[22] On this basis, Zuma continued to ignore the Public Protector's recommendations. 
On 8 October 2015 the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa handed down a judgment in a separate matter (namely SABC v DA, about the Hlaudi Motsoeneng saga) that found the Public Protector's reports are legally binding.[23] In doing so the Court reversed the High Court, whose judgment on 24 October 2014 had said the reports are merely advisory.[24]

A week before the hearing, the Presidency made a surprise attempt to settle the matter and compiled a draft order offering to pay back some of the money.[25][26] The Public Protector noted that the draft order reflected only "partial" compliance with her recommendations.[27] The EFF made a counter-offer in the form of a draft order stating that the Nkandla report was legally binding on Zuma and that by failing to implement it he had breached the South African Constitution and his oath of office.[27] The parties failed to reach a settlement.

Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) is a South African socio-economic policy framework implemented by the African National Congress (ANC) government of Nelson Mandela in 1994 after months of discussions, consultations and negotiations between the ANC, its Alliance partners the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party, and "mass organisations in the wider civil society".[1] 
The ANC's chief aim in developing and implementing the Reconstruction and Development Programme, was to address the immense socioeconomic problems brought about by the consequences of the struggle against its predecessors under the Apartheid regime. 
Specifically, it set its sights on alleviating poverty and addressing the massive shortfalls in social services across the country—something that the document acknowledged would rely upon a stronger macroeconomic environment.[1] Achieving poverty alleviation and a stronger economy were thus seen as deeply interrelated and mutually supporting objectives—development without growth would be financially unsustainable, while growth without development would fail to bring about the necessary structural transformation within South Africa's deeply inequitable and largely impoverished population. Hence the RDP attempted to combine measures to boost the economy such as contained fiscal spending, sustained or lowered taxes, reduction of government debt and trade liberalisation with socially minded social service provisions and infrastructural projects. 
In this way, the policy took on both socialist and neo-liberal elements—but could not be easily categorised wholly in either camp. 
Notes 
Social achievements of the RDP 
Proponents of the RDP argue that the programme oversaw many major advances in dealing with South Africa's most severe social problems: 
Housing: Between 1994 and the start of 2001 over 1.1 million cheap houses eligible for government subsidies had been built, accommodating 5 million of the estimated 12.5 million South Africans without proper housing.[2] In some instances, RDP housing delivery led to violent conflicts within communities. Clean water: By the beginning of 1998, standpipes had been installed within 200 metres of the dwellings of about 1.3 million rural people. 
By August of that year, Minister of Water Affairs Kader Asmal stated that since he had taken office more than 2.5 million people had been given access to fresh safe water. 
By 2000, a total of 236 projects had supplied clean piped water to nearly 4.9 million people—most of whom were inhabitants of former homelands.[2] Electrification: Between 1994 and May 2000 around 1.75 million homes had been connected to the national grid, while the proportion of rural homes with electricity grew from 12% to 42%.[2] Land reform: By 1999 some 39,000 families had been settled on 3,550 square kilometres of land. 
Authorities claimed that 250,000 people had 'received land' within four years.[2] Healthcare: Between April 1994 and the end of 1998, around 500 new clinics gave an additional 5 million people access to primary health care facilities. 
Under the polio-hepatitis vaccination programme that began in 1998, 8 million children were immunised within two years.[2] Public works: A community-based Public Works Programme provided employment over five years to 240,000 people on road-building schemes and the installation of sewage, sanitation facilities and water supplies.[2] 
Critics have questioned the scope of change represented by many of the statistics, and have argued that realities on the ground signify a far more modest improvement than the government claims. 
They have attacked, in particular, the standards of housing and water delivery, healthcare improvements and the successfulness of land reform policy and agricultural reforms: 
Housing: Critics of the RDP point to poor housing quality as the chief problem being faced. One research investigation in 2000 found that only 30% of new houses complied with building regulations. 
Critics also note that new housing schemes are often dreary in their planning and layout—to the extent that they often strongly resemble the en masse bleak building programmes of the Apartheid government during the 1950s and 60s.[1] Clean water: Critics of the RDP have targeted in particular the government's assertions regarding the provision of clean water—citing an array of problems and complications with RDP policies that have led to their partial or full failure during the implementation stage. 
Lodge notes [2] that water projects faced, in many cases, severe design faults that led to unworkable bureaucratic messes on the ground. 
Subsequently, the percentage of households relying on rivers, streams and dams for their water actually increased slightly between 1995 and 1999[3] while the percentage of households using piped water only increased slightly. In 2000 the government announced a major change in policy by providing free basic allowances of 6,000 litres per month—solving the financial restrictions of the rural poor in accessing water, but placing even more doubt in the financial sustainability of the schemes.[2] Land reform: The number of families settled on land under the RDP was way off the Programme's goal—the RDP had aimed to resettle families on 300,000 square kilometres of land—in reality only just over 1% of this goal was achieved. 
Moreover, the advances in many other areas of public services came partly through the removal of agricultural subsidies—which subsequently created huge job losses. 
Between 1994 and 1998 the number of workers on commercial farms declined from 1.4 million to just 637,000.[2] Thus the number of people employed in the agricultural sector actually declined substantially under the RDP. 
Healthcare: Critics of the RDP argue that access to healthcare only improved slightly under the RDP and that, even with moderately improved access, standards at many medical institutions declined rapidly. 
They cite, in the first place, that usage of healthcare facilities increased by just 1.6% between 1995 and 1999, and that even these modest improvements have been eclipsed by the advance of the AIDS pandemic and other health epidemics such as malaria. Between 1995 and 1998 life expectancy of South Africans fell from 64.1 years to 53.2 years, with AIDS patients sometimes occupying up to 40% of beds in public hospitals. 
This, say critics, is indicative of a "public health system... in crisis" rather than one undergoing positive transformation.[2] Equally troubling has been declining quality of services—Lodge notes,[2] for example, that in Soweto 950,000 patients attended primary healthcare clinics in 1994 where they were seen by 800 nurses—but by 2000 the number of patients had spiralled to about 2,000,000 while the number of nurses had fallen to just 500.

Emma Millinda Gillett (1852–1927) was an American lawyer and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the advancement of legal studies for women. 
After being denied from local law schools because of her gender, she was admitted by Howard University, a historically black university. 
Yet, the Washington College of Law, which she founded in 1898, did not accept people of color until 1950.[1] 
Gillett was born on July 30, 1852, in Princeton, Wisconsin, to Wisconsin homesteaders.[1][2] She was educated in Girard, Pennsylvania, where her family moved following the death of her father.[1] In 1870, she graduated from Lake Erie College and taught for the following ten years in the Pennsylvania public school system.[1] During her time as a teacher, she became frustrated with the meager wages paid to single women teachers.[1]

Kaizer Chiefs Football Club (often known as Chiefs) is a South African professional soccer club based in Naturena, Johannesburg South, that plays in the Premier Soccer League. 
The team is nicknamed AmaKhosi, which means "Lords" or "Chiefs" in Zulu, and the Phefeni Glamour Boys. 
Chiefs have won 13 league titles (four in the PSL era) and over 50 club trophies. 
As a result, they hold the most trophies amongst all clubs in South Africa and are the most successful team in South African football history since the start of the top flight in 1970. 
They are the most supported club in the country, drawing an average home attendance of 16,144 in the 2019–20 season, the highest in the league. 
The team plays its home matches at the 94,797 capacity FNB Stadium.[1] 
The team has a strong local rivalry with Orlando Pirates, a fellow Soweto team which Chiefs founder Kaizer Motaung played for in his early playing career. 
Famous players who donned the black and gold jersey in the past include former national team captains Neil Tovey and Lucas Radebe as well as Patrick Ntsoelengoe, Gary Bailey, John "Shoes" Moshoeu, Shaun Bartlett, Steve Komphela, Siyabonga Nomvete and Doctor Khumalo. 
The Kaizer Chiefs were banned by the African Football (CAF) from competing in African club competitions until 2009 after their abrupt withdrawal from the 2005 CAF Confederation Cup. 
This was the second time in four years that Chiefs had been penalized by CAF for refusal to participate in a competition. 
He died of old age on 6 January 2020 at the age of 99. 
He was laid to rest at the Westpark Cemetery on Tuesday 14 January 2020.[1]

Mabel Patronella Mentor (19 October 1963 - 23 August 2022), known as Vytjie Mentor, was a South African politician who served as a Member of the National Assembly from 2002 until 2014. 
She represented the African National Congress and served as the party's caucus chairperson between 2004 and 2008. 
She was chairperson of the portfolio committee on public enterprises from 2009 to 2010. 
She is credited to be one of the first people to break ranks with the ANC and raise the alarm on state capture.[1] 
Mabel Patronella Mentor was born on 19 October 1963 in the former Cape Province of South Africa. 
She matriculated from Batlhaping High School in Taung. 
She studied at Hebron Theological College, East Rand College, and the University of the Witwatersrand. 
Mentor also studied through UNISA.[2] 
Mentor was a long-standing member of the African National Congress. 
She was sworn in as an MP in 2002 and was elected to her first full term in 2004.[3][4] After the election, she was named as chairperson of the party's caucus, succeeding Joyce Kgoali. 
She held the position until 2008, when Ncumisa Chwayita Kondlo was announced as her successor.[5] 
In March 2016, Mentor claimed that in 2010 the Gupta family, on behalf of Zuma, offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, if she could arrange that South African Airways drop their Johannesburg to Mumbai route, so that Jet Airways could acquire it.[9][10] She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while Zuma was in another room.[11] The family denied that the meeting took place and Zuma said he had no recollection of Mentor.[12][13] In August 2018, she testified at The Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture.[14] She was cross-examined in February 2019 after some parts of her testimony were found to be inconsistent.

Enos John Nganani Mabuza (6 June 1939 – 13 December 1997) was born at Sheba gold mine in Barberton on June 6, 1939. 
He attended school up to Standard eight and thereafter obtained a primary teacher's diploma in Vryheid, Natal. 
He then studied privately for his matric, and in 1978 received an honours degree in psychology through UNISA. 
Mabuza also served as chief executive councillor (23 June 1977 to 18 June 1982 and 9 December 1982 to 31 August 1984) and chief minister (31 August 1984 to 1 April 1991) of the Bantustan of KaNgwane of South Africa. 
Mabuza was a teacher by profession and he loved English grammar and he was known for being a perfectionist. 
He also contributed a lot in the development of the siSwati language in schools. 
In 1969 he was appointed headmaster at Khumbula secondary school in White River in the Eastern Transvaal. 
Three years later he was appointed an inspector, of schools, and five years later he left education for politics a controversial step at the time to become leader of the then fledgling Kangwane legislative assembly. 
That move led to his founding of the Inyandza Movement, which was to bring about political organisation and cohesion, which had been lacking in the area at the time.[1] 
The Inyandza Movement played a critical role in preventing attempts by the South African government to incorporate the KaNgwane homeland into Swaziland. 
He took the South African apartheid government to court and won and this brought Mabuza national prominence. 
He made common cause with the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), as the territory of Ngwavuma in Northern Natal was also under threat of incorporation. 
His relationship with the IFP ended acrimoniously when Mabuza, in defiance of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, led a delegation to meet the ANC in Lusaka. 
After the 1990 unbanning of political parties, Inyandza merged into the ANC and Mabuza promptly resigned from active politics and entered the corporate world.[2][3] Mabuza succumbed from pancreas cancer in 1997.

Babita Deokaran was assassinated at around 08:00 SAST on 23 August 2021 while she was returning home from dropping her daughter off at school.[3] A vehicle pulled alongside her vehicle and fired multiple shots after she had parked in front of her house in Johannesburg South, Gauteng Province, South Africa resulting in her death.[4][5] The case caused significant controversy in South Africa given Deokaran's status as an anti-corruption whistleblower and the lack of protection afforded to her by the state. 
Deokaran was the acting chief financial officer at the Gauteng Provincial Government Department of Health.[6][7] It was reported in the media that her death was linked to a corrupt COVID-19 PPE procurement scandal to the value of R332 million (equivalent to US$20 million)[8] within the Gauteng Provincial Department of Health.[9][10] An official from the South African Special Investigative Unit confirmed that Deokaran was a key witness in the investigation to expose a syndicate setup to benefit from state corruption.[6] Deokaran had been on special leave for more than a year prior to her death whilst the investigation was underway.[8] 
The six suspects were reported by the media to have been hired assassins[1] with Cape Talk reporting that they were allegedly paid R2 million.[15] News24 news wire reported that the following suspects had been arrested Nhlanganiso Ndlovu, Siphakanyisa Dladla, Zitha Radebe, Simphiwe Mazibuko, Sanele Mbele, Phakamani Radebe; they also reported that more arrests were likely in the future.[2] Due to water supply issues affecting the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court, the bail hearing was postponed to 30 November 2021.[16] 
Deokaran's murder received considerable attention in the media. 
The Daily Maverick published an editorial questioning why public officials received generous protection details whilst witnesses who blow the whistle on serious acts of corruption, like Deokaran, received no protection thereby raising questions about the South African government's commitment to fighting corruption in South Africa.[17] Following her death South African president Cyril Ramaphosa stated that more state protection should be afforded to whistleblowers in the fight against corruption.[18] 
Swazi warriors dancing incwala 
Incwala (Swazi: [iᵑǀwala]) is the main ritual of kingship in the Kingdom of Eswatini.[1] This is a national event that takes place during the summer solstice.[2] The main participant in incwala is the King of Eswatini; when there is no king there is no incwala.[3] Incwala takes place over a period of time of about a month, starting with the small incwala, incwala lencane, and culminating in the big incwala, incwala lenkhulu. 
A number of activities—such as lusekwane, kuhlamahlama, and umdvutjulwa—mark the key events of this age old tradition. 
Paul Mpande Ngobeni was born in Lydenburg, Transvaal Province, South Africa on 1 September 1960. 
He went to the United States on a scholarship in 1982[1] graduated with a BA (magna cum laude) from Hamilton College, New York, and a JD from New York University School of Law.[citation needed] 
On 20 January 2006, bar counsel filed a petition in Massachusetts for reciprocal discipline based on the interim suspension order entered in Connecticut. 
On 16 March 2006, the court issued an order of immediate temporary suspension, after Ngobeni had failed to respond. In a presentment filed in the Connecticut Superior Court on 25 September 2006, disciplinary counsel in Connecticut alleged seventeen counts of misconduct involving sixteen separate clients. 
The presentment, as amended, included allegations that the respondent took fees without providing services, was incompetent, lacked diligence, failed to communicate with clients, engaged in misrepresentation and deceit, failed to explain an overdraft in his clients' funds account, failed to safeguard clients' funds, and failed to respond to requests for information from the Connecticut bar discipline authorities.[11] 
He is currently employed as a special advisor to the South African Minister of Defence and Veteran Affairs. 
He was previously employed by the University of Cape Town as a Deputy Registrar, Legal Services.[2] In 2007 Mr Ngobeni was appointed to serve on a task team advising the African National Congress on constitutional law matters where he assisted in designing its legal strategy for defending South African President Jacob Zuma against corruption charges. 
He has also served as a consultant for the South African Ministry of Housing on various legal matters, including transformation.

Paul Ngobeni was admitted to practise law in the State of Connecticut December 1989 [3] and to the State of Massachusetts on 14 June 1990 [4] During his practice in the United States, Mr Ngobeni litigated many cases which have been published[citation needed] and were for the most part cases of first impression, such as the case of Scott v. Robert Jamison, et al., where he (unsuccessfully) defended Robert Jamison against complaints from Juliet Scott that she was physically and verbally assaulted and harassed, denied equal services, and threatened with eviction on the basis of her race and colour and of her children's race and colour in violation of General Statutes § 46a-64c(a) and Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.[5] 
In July 2002, Kweku Hanson, a fellow Connecticut attorney, initiated a class-action suit against Ocwen Federal FSB of West Palm Beach, Florida, and he was represented in this by Paul Ngobeni. 
The 123-page lawsuit in Hanson v. Ocwen Federal Bank outlines a six-year running battle over late charges and fees.[6] 
"It is clear that this is a pattern and practice of sheer piracy," Mr. Hanson said in an interview. 
He was joined in the suit by 57 individuals who claimed to have been injured by Ocwen. 
The lawsuit sought $1.5 billion in punitive and exemplary damages, but was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. 
On 27 September 2005, the Connecticut Office of the Chief Disciplinary Counsel filed an application for the interim suspension of Paul Ngobeni, alleging that he "pose[d] a substantial threat of irreparable harm to his clients or to prospective clients." 
On 19 December 2005, after he failed to appear for a hearing on this application, a judge in the Superior Court for the Hartford Judicial District in Connecticut ordered that he be placed on interim suspension. 
Kweku Joseph Hanson (born June 21, 1961, in Accra, Ghana) graduated with an AB from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, ME in 1985 and Doctor of Jurisprudence (Juris Doctor, or JD, approximately equivalent to LLB) degree from University of Connecticut School of Law in 1988. 
He was subsequently disbarred as an attorney and immigration law practitioner due to numerous complaints involving unethical conduct, non-delivery of service, maladministration of client's funds,[1] as well as his conviction on charges of sexual assault, child pornography and tampering with witnesses.[2] 
On November 1, 2007, Hanson pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault in the second degree; two counts of risk of injury to a minor child; one charge of possession of child pornography in the first degree; and two counts of tampering with a witness.[1] He received a total effective sentence of twenty-five years execution suspended after he served six years incarceration followed by thirty years of probation. 
Prior to his sentencing Hanson attempted to withdraw his "guilty" plea, claiming, in part, that he didn't understand the criminal charges lodged against him and the court had failed to adequately apprise him of the sentencing range related to those charges during a process known as plea canvassing. 
In September 2000, he represented a West Hartford woman who sued Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford Motor Co., seeking $60 million for the "humiliation, mental anguish and emotional distress" she had suffered while driving her Ford Explorer, which was equipped with recalled tires. 
Rhona Baugh-Seawright had been "panicky and scared" for the two months since she learned of the nationwide recall, according to Kweku J. Hanson, after filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hartford. 
"Her lawsuit does not seek any redress for personal injury due to an accident," he said.[3] 
During 2003, he, along with Paul Ngobeni, his associate from the Ocwen class action suit, represented three plaintiffs who claimed to represent "all persons who lived in South Africa between 1948 and the present and who suffered damages as a result of apartheid." 
Punitive and compensatory damages in excess $400 billion were claimed from a "slew" of multinational corporations (including IBM, Citigroup, GE, DuPont and many others) that did business in apartheid South Africa for violations of international law subject to suit in United States federal district court under the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1350 ("ATCA"), and other jurisdictional provisions. 
Two other South African anti-apartheid lawsuits—the Khulumani et al., vs Barclays Bank et al., lawsuit; and the Ntsebeza vs Daimler Chrysler Corp lawsuit had previously been initiated separately during 2002. 
The Southern District Court of New York under Judge John E. Sprizzo found for defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.[5] That finding was partially vacated by the US Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) in an appeal first lodged in January 2006 and decided in October 2007[6] but by then Mr Hanson was no longer representing the claimants.[7] 
Hamilton College is a private liberal arts college in Clinton, Oneida County, New York. 
It was founded as Hamilton-Oneida Academy in 1793 and was chartered as Hamilton College in 1812 in honor of inaugural trustee Alexander Hamilton, following a proposal brought forward after his death in 1804. 
Hamilton has been coeducational since 1978, when it merged with its coordinate sister school Kirkland College. 
Clinton (or Ka-dah-wis-dag, "white field" in Seneca language[2]) is a village in Oneida County, New York, United States. The population was 1,942 at the 2010 census. 
It was named for George Clinton, the first Governor of New York.[3] 
The Village of Clinton, site of Hamilton College, is within the Town of Kirkland. 
The village was known as the "village of schools" due to the large number of private schools operating in the village during the 19th century. 
Lydenburg, officially known as Mashishing, is a town in Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, on the Mpumalanga highveld, South Africa. 
It is situated on the Sterkspruit/Dorps River tributary of the Lepelle River at the summit of the Long Tom Pass. 
It has a long, rich history, ranging from AD 500 to the present. 
The name is derived from the Dutch Lijdenburg, or "Town of Suffering", and is named for the experiences of the white settlers.[2][3] In Northern Sotho, Mashishing means "long green grass."[4] Lydenburg has become the centre of the South African fly-fishing industry and is an agricultural, tourism and mining hub. 
Sekhukune I succeeded his father in 1861 and repelled an attack against the Swazi. 
At the time, there were also border disputes with the Transvaal, which lead to the formation of Burgersfort, which was manned by volunteers from Lydenburg. 
By the 1870s, the Pedi were one of three alternative sources of regional authority, alongside the Swazi and the ZAR (Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek). 
The Pedi /pɛdi/ or Bapedi /bæˈpɛdi/ (also known as the Northern Sotho or Basotho ba Leboa and the Marota or Bamaroteng) – are a southern African ethnic group that speak Pedi or Sepedi, a dialect[2] belonging to the Sotho-Tswana enthnolinguistic group. Northern Sotho is a term used to refer to one of South Africa's 11 official languages. 
Northern Sotho or Sesotho sa Leboa consist of 33 dialects, of which Pedi is one of them.[3] 
The BaPedi people are almost exclusively found in South Africa's northeastern provinces which are Limpopo, and parts of northern Mpumalanga. 
There is confusion regarding the distinction between BaPedi people, and tribes referred to Northern Sotho (Basotho ba Lebowa). 
On the one hand, one military explanation is that the BaPedi people became powerful at one point under a powerful king that ruled over a large piece of land. 
During this period, a powerful army of the BaPedi conquered smaller tribes, and proclaimed paramountcy over them. 
On the other hand, another explanation is that after the decline of one of the BaPedi Kingdom, some tribes separated from the kingship, hence the use of the term Northern Sotho. 
One reason for separation might be related to the power battle that has been raging for many years between the varying factions in the BaPedi Kingdom. 
In the year 2020, Judge Ephraim Makgoba made a ruling on the rivalry between members of the BaPedi traditional council.[4] 
Rustenburg (/ˈrʌstənbɜːrɡ/; Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈrœstənbœrχ], Afrikaans and Dutch: City of Rest[4]) is a city at the foot of the Magaliesberg mountain range. 
Rustenburg is the most populous city in North West province, South Africa (549,575 in 2011 and 626,522 in the 2016 census).[5] In 2017, the city's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) reached ZAR 63.8 billion,[6][7][8] accounting for 21.1% of the GDP of the North West Province, and 1.28% of the GDP of South Africa. Rustenburg was one of the official host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, being in close proximity to Phokeng, the capital of the Royal Bafokeng Nation, where the Royal Bafokeng Stadium is located. 
The England national football team also used this as their base camp for the tournament. 
Sekhukhune II was the paramount King of the Bapedi and grandson of Sekhukhune I. He reigned during the Second Anglo-Boer War.[1] 
Sekhukhune's reign marked the final collapse of the Bapedi resistance against the occupation of their land by the South African Republic and the British Empire.Sekhukhune II his heir Thulare II predeceased him and Kgobalale was appointed as a regent instead of his elder brother Seraki. 
It was the pedi nation as large that turned down the appointment of Seraki due to his unruly behaviour. 
They believed that if Kgobalale should have a problem he could notify his brother Seraki as he was trusted to when it comes to war.

Artifacts indicating human activity dating back to the early Stone Age have been found in the Kingdom of Eswatini. 
The earliest known inhabitants of the region were Khoisan hunter-gatherers. 
Later, the population became predominantly Nguni during and after the great Bantu migrations. 
People speaking languages ancestral to the current Sotho and Nguni languages began settling no later than the 11th century.[1] The country now derives its name from a later king named Mswati II. 
Mswati II was the greatest of the fighting kings of Eswatini, and he greatly extended the area of the country to twice its current size. 
The people of Eswatini largely belong to a number of clans that can be categorized as Emakhandzambili, Bemdzabu, and Emafikamuva, depending on when and how they settled in Eswatini. 
An encyclopedia (American English), or encyclopaedia (British English) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline.[1] Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name[2] or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable by random access. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries.[2] Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.[3][4][5][6]

Misuzulu Sinqobile kaZwelithini[1] (born 23 September 1974) is the reigning King of the Zulu nation. 
While Misuzulu is the third oldest surviving son of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, he is the first son of King Goodwill Zwelithini's Great Wife, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini. 
Misuzulu became heir presumptive after the death of his father on 12 March 2021,[2][3] however although being officially appointed as the king of the Zulu nation, his traditional coronation did not take place until 20 August 2022 after the customary entering the cattle kraal ceremony, ukungena esibayeni. The King was officially coronated and recognized by the government on 29 October 2022.[4][5][6] 
Despite being King Goodwill Zwelithini's third oldest surviving son, King Misuzulu's accession to the throne was not instant. 
Historically, King Misuzulu's claim to the throne would have been automatic, but the Zulu Kingdom now considers itself a constitutional monarchy, the leader of which must be appointed.[1] King Goodwill Zwelithini's Great Wife, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini, was appointed regent during the interregnum and, on 24 March 2021, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi issued a statement on behalf of the Zulu Royal Family stating that the new king would only be announced after the three-month mourning period for the late King Goodwill Zwelithini.[8] King Goodwill Zwelithini's will gave the responsibility of appointing the next king to Queen Mantfombi.[9][10] 
Mantfombi Shiyiwe Dlamini Zulu (15 February 1953 – 29 April 2021) was the queen consort of the Zulu nation from 1977 to 2021 as the Great Wife to King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
She served as the queen regent from March 2021 to April 2021. 
Queen Mantfombi Dlamini was born on 15 February 1953[1] to the House of Dlamini. Born to King Sobhuza II of Swaziland and Princess Manoni, who was herself the granddaughter of King Mbandzeni, a former Swati king, Mantfombi's father Sobhuza II, as Ngwenyama of the Swazi Nation, became the King of Swaziland at independence in 1968. 
Queen Mantfombi's brother,[2] Sobhuza's successor Mswati III, would ultimately change their country's name to Eswatini in 2018.[3] 
After a traditional upbringing in the Swazi royal family, the princess was betrothed to King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulu Nation in 1973. 
At the time of their betrothal, she was a member of the royal family of a sovereign state. 
Her intended husband was a chief recognised by the South African government as the traditional authority of Zululand. 
Considering their relative dynastic seniority, the Swazi palace laid a condition for the marriage: the princess was to become the King's Great Wife, a position that would give her male children first place in the line of succession. 
The Zulu agreed, and the couple married in 1977.[1]

Janusz Waluś and Clive Derby-Lewis were sentenced to death for their actions, but after the abolition of the death penalty in South Africa their sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. 
With the introduction of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission after apartheid, Waluś applied for amnesty, which would give him parole. 
After extensive investigation the commission found that he and Derby-Lewis were not acting on higher orders and refused amnesty; he remained in prison.[1] Clive Derby-Lewis was released from prison in June 2015 after serving 22 years;[9] he died over a year later, on November 3, 2016, from lung cancer.[10] 
On 10 March 2016, the High Court in Pretoria ruled that Waluś should be released on parole.[11] The Department of Home Affairs indicated in September 2016 that Waluś would be stripped of his South African citizenship and deported back to Poland if he was released on parole.[12] 
On 16 March 2020, Waluś was again denied parole by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.[17] In February 2022, the Constitutional Court is scheduled to hear an appeal against these prior decisions.[18][19] 
Aftermath 
In 2018, Waluś told Polish Journalist Cezary Lazarewicz that "in 1993, there was a war in South Africa and he felt like a soldier... 
He still believes in the system of racial segregation and that whites and blacks should live apart."[20]

Janusz Jakub Waluś[1] (/ˈjɑːnəs ˈwɒləs/, Polish: [ˈjanuʂ ˈjakup ˈvaluɕ]; born 14 January 1953)[2] is a Goral Polish convicted murderer. He held dual Polish-South African citizenship from 1986 until his South African citizenship was revoked in 2017. 
Waluś is serving a life sentence in C-Max in Pretoria for the 1993 assassination of Chris Hani, General Secretary of the South African Communist Party and chief of staff of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). 
On 13 November 2020, Waluś was refused parole for the fourth time, despite his lawyer's claim that he was completely rehabilitated.[3] 
Janusz Waluś was born in Zakopane in Communist-ruled Poland and, in 1981, emigrated to South Africa to join his father and brother, who had arrived in South Africa in the 1970s and established a small glass factory. 
After the family business went bankrupt some years later, Waluś, then a truck driver,[4] joined both the National Party and the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, becoming more and more involved in the far right politics supporting South Africa's apartheid regime.[5] 
The assassination of Chris Hani took place on Easter Saturday, 10 April 1993, a time when negotiations to end apartheid were taking place.[6][7] Waluś drove to Chris Hani's house in Boksburg, Johannesburg, around 10:20 am. 
Hani had just returned home and, as he got out of his car, Waluś called out his name, at which Hani turned around and was shot once in the body and then three times in the head. 
Hani died on the scene, while Waluś fled. 
A neighbour noted the registration of the car fleeing the scene, which resulted in Waluś's capture. 
Although Waluś denied any participation in the assassination, he made the mistake of assuming one of the policemen was a right-winger and exposed his own story.[8] Thorough investigation revealed that Clive Derby-Lewis had instigated the assassination and organized the acquisition of the weapon for Waluś. 
The police found a hit-list that suggested Hani was the third target on Waluś's and Derby-Lewis's list, which also included the names and addresses of Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo, among others.[8] 
Influence 
Hani was a charismatic leader, with significant support among the radical anti-apartheid youth. 
At the time of his death, he was the most popular ANC leader after his senior, Nelson Mandela.[1] Following the legalisation of the ANC, Hani's support for the negotiation process with the apartheid government was critical in keeping the militants in line.[24] 
Chris Hani (28 June 1942 – 10 April 1993),[1] born Martin Thembisile Hani SSA, SBS, CLS, DMG, MMS was the leader of the South African Communist Party and chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC). He was a fierce opponent of the apartheid government, and was assassinated by Janusz Waluś, a Polish immigrant and sympathiser of the Conservative opposition on 10 April 1993, during the unrest preceding the transition to democracy.[2]

The party was an Afrikaner ethnic nationalist party that promoted Afrikaner interests in South Africa.[5] However, in 1990 it became a South African civic nationalist party seeking to represent all South Africans. It first became the governing party of the country in 1924. It merged with its rival, the SAP, during the Great Depression, and a splinter faction became the official opposition during World War II and returned to power and governed South Africa from 4 June 1948 until 9 May 1994. 
Beginning in 1948 following the general election, the party as the governing party of South Africa began implementing its policy of racial segregation, known as apartheid (the Afrikaans term for "separateness"). Although White-minority rule and racial segregation were already in existence in South Africa with non-Whites not having voting rights and efforts made to encourage segregation, apartheid intensified the segregation with stern penalties for non-Whites entering into areas designated for Whites-only without having a pass to permit them to do so (known as the pass laws), interracial marriage and sexual relationships were illegal and punishable offences, and black people faced significant restrictions on property rights. 
After South Africa was condemned by the British Commonwealth for its policies of apartheid, the NP-led government had South Africa leave the Commonwealth, abandon its monarchy led by the British monarch and become an independent republic. 
During the 1970s and 1980s, the NP-led government faced internal unrest in South Africa and international pressure for accommodation of non-Whites in South Africa. 
It resulted in policies of granting concessions to the non-White population, while still retaining the apartheid system, such as the creation of Bantustans that were autonomous self-governing Black homelands (criticised for several of them being broken up into unconnected pieces and that they were still dominated by the White minority South African government), removing legal prohibitions on interracial marriage, and legalising non-White and multiracial political parties (however the outlawed though very popular African National Congress (ANC), was not legalised due to the government identifying it as a terrorist organisation). Those identified as Coloureds and Indian South Africans were granted separate legislatures in 1983 alongside the main legislature that represented Whites to provide them self-government while maintaining apartheid, but no such legislature was provided to the Black population as their self-government was to be provided through the Bantustans. The NP-led government began changing laws affected by the apartheid system that had come under heavy domestic and international condemnation such as removing the pass laws, granting Blacks full property rights that ended previous major restrictions on Black ownership of land, and the right to form trade unions. 
Following escalating economic sanctions over apartheid, negotiations between the NP-led government led by P. W. Botha and the outlawed ANC led by then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela began in 1987 with Botha seeking to accommodate the ANC's demands and consider releasing Mandela and legalising the ANC on the condition that it would renounce use of political violence to attain its aims.

Jessica Alves (born 30 July 1983)[1] is a Brazilian-British television personality noted for having undergone dozens of plastic surgeries to alter her appearance. Prior to her transition, she was often referred to as a human Ken doll. 
Alves has had several episodes of surgery, including nose jobs which resulted in the loss of her sense of smell.[1] Soon after that experience she underwent surgery in Brazil to inject a gel into her arms to make them look more muscular.[9] She lost use of both arms for a while and the experience led her to seek psychotherapy.[9] In 2013, Alves was diagnosed with body dysmorphia; a “mental health condition where a person spends an obsessive amount of time worrying about flaws in their appearance”.[9]

World War I or the First World War, often abbreviated as WWI or WW1, and referred to by some Anglophone authors as the "Great War" or the "War to End All Wars", was a global conflict which lasted from 1914 to 1918, and is considered one of the deadliest conflicts in history. 
Belligerents included much of Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States, and the Ottoman Empire, with fighting occurring throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and parts of Asia. 
An estimated 9 million soldiers were killed in combat, plus another 23 million wounded, while 5 million civilians died as a result of military action, hunger, and disease.[2] Millions more died in genocides within the Ottoman Empire and in the 1918 influenza pandemic, which was exacerbated by the movement of combatants during the war.[3][4]

baKoni ruins 
The hills around the town are terraced with thousands of stone walls which form part of a vast complex of settlements, fields and roads. 
Some tour guides describe these as South Africa's "real" lost city.[3] South of Machadodorp, on the lands of the farm Rietvlei lies the former Bokoni capital Moxomatsi. 
Machadodorp, also known by its official name eNtokozweni, is a small town situated near the edge of the escarpment in the Mpumalanga province, South Africa. The Elands River runs through the town. 
There is a natural radioactive spring here that is reputed to have powerful healing qualities.[citation needed] 
Bokoni (meaning 'land of the people from the north') was a pre-colonial, agro-pastoral society found in northwestern and southern parts of present-day Mpumalanga province, South Africa.[1] Iconic to this area are stone-walled sites, found in a variety of shapes and forms. 
Bokoni sites also exhibit specialized farming and long-distance trading with other groups in surrounding regions. 
Bokoni saw occupation in varying forms between approximately 1500 and 1820 A.D. 
Bokoni sites are found almost continuously between Orighstad and Carolina, usually along the various rivers branching out to the east and west along this 150 kilometer stretch.[8][9] Bokoni communities generally consisted of centralized, large villages, found on valley hills; with smaller settlements bearing similarities surrounding them.[10] The largest of the villages associated with Bokoni have been measured at over 5 kilometers across.[11] There are a few notable outliers to these patterns: including clusters of sites in the nearby southern Komati Valley, and within the Crocodile Tributaries. 
A single cluster of sites can also be found to the west of the general Bokoni region, in the Steelpoort Valley; but these sites do not bear the same characteristics as other Bokoni sites, and have been somewhat ignored in various analyses. 
The Bokoni region has also been described more generally as being between the Leolu Mountains, the Spekboom River, and the Badfontein Valley.[7] 
Settlements across the Bokoni region are also seen to span a considerable range of altitudes. 
Population estimate studies have placed the Bokoni population at the society's height to be somewhere in the range of 19,000 and 57,000 individuals.[12] 
Waterval Boven (officially known as Emgwenya[2]) is a small town situated on the edge of the Escarpment on the banks of the Elands River above the 75m Elands Falls on the railway line from Pretoria to Maputo in Mpumalanga, South Africa. Hence the name, which is Dutch for "above the waterfall". 
Robben Island as viewed from Table Mountain towards Saldanha Bay 
Robben Island (Afrikaans: Robbeneiland) is an island in Table Bay, 6.9 kilometres (4.3 mi) west of the coast of Bloubergstrand, north of Cape Town, South Africa. 
It takes its name from the Dutch word for seals (robben), hence the Dutch/Afrikaans name Robbeneiland, which translates to Seal(s) Island. 
Robben Island is roughly oval in shape, 3.3 kilometres (2 miles) long north–south, and 1.9 km (1+1⁄8 mi) wide, with an area of 5.08 km2 (1+31⁄32 sq mi).[2] It is flat and only a few metres above sea level, as a result of an ancient erosion event. 
It was fortified and used as a prison from the late-seventeenth century until 1996, after the end of apartheid. 
Makhanda, also known as Grahamstown, is a town[lower-alpha 1] of about 140,000 people in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. 
It is situated about 110 kilometres (70 mi) northeast of Port Elizabeth and 130 kilometres (80 mi) southwest of East London. 
Makhanda is the largest town in the Makana Local Municipality, and the seat of the municipal council. 
It also hosts Rhodes University, the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court, the South African Library for the Blind (SALB), a diocese of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, and 6 South African Infantry Battalion. 
Furthermore, located approximately 3 km south-east of the town lies the world renowned Waterloo Farm, the only estuarine fossil site in the world from 360 million years ago with exceptional soft-tissue preservation.[4]

Rhodes has six faculties, listed below: 
The six faculties are further subdivided into 30 academic departments, of which 11 form part of the humanities faculty. 
The humanities faculty, being the largest in the university, consists of 40% of the student intake of undergraduate and postgraduate studies, enrolling 2669 students as of 2009.[11] 
Rhodes University is a public research university located in Makhanda (Grahamstown) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.[3] It is one of four universities in the province. 
Established in 1904, Rhodes University is the province's oldest university, and it is the sixth oldest South African university in continuous operation, being preceded by the University of the Free State (1904),[4] University of Witwatersrand (1896), University of South Africa (1873) as the University of the Cape of Good Hope,[5] Stellenbosch University (1866)[6] and the University of Cape Town (1829).[7] Rhodes was founded in 1904 as Rhodes University College, named after Cecil Rhodes, through a grant from the Rhodes Trust. 
It became a constituent college of the University of South Africa in 1918 before becoming an independent university in 1951. 
The history of the plague in the village began in 1665 when a flea-infested bundle of cloth arrived from London for Alexander Hadfield, the local tailor.[16] Within a week his assistant George Viccars, noticing the bundle was damp, had opened it up.[17] Before long he was dead and more began dying in the household soon after.[18] 
Eyam ( /ˈiːm/)[2] is an English village and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales that lies within the Peak District National Park. There is evidence of early occupation by Ancient Britons on the surrounding moors and lead was mined in the area by the Romans.[3] A settlement was founded on the present site by Anglo-Saxons, when mining was continued and other industries later developed. 
However, Eyam’s main claim to fame is the story of how the village chose to go into isolation so as to prevent infection spreading after bubonic plague was discovered there in 1665.[4] 
Today Eyam has many plague-related places of interest. 
One is the Boundary Stone in the fields between Eyam and Stony Middleton in which money, usually soaked in vinegar, which was believed to kill the infection, was placed in exchange for food and medicine. 
It is just one of several 'plague stones' marking the boundary that should not be crossed by either inhabitant or outsider. 
Another site is the isolated enclosure of the Riley graves mentioned above, now under the guardianship of the National Trust. 
A reminder of the village's industrial past remains in the name of its only pub, the Miner's Arms. 
Built in 1630, before the plague, it was originally called The Kings Arms. 
Opposite the church is the Mechanics' Institute, originally established in 1824,[23] although the present building with its pillared portico dates from 1859 and was enlarged in 1894. At one time, it held a library paid for by subscription, which then contained 766 volumes.[24] The premises now double as the village club. 
Up the main street is the Jacobean-styled Eyam Hall, built just after the plague. 
It was leased and managed by the National Trust for five years until December 2017 but is now run by the owners (the Wright Family). 
The green opposite has an ancient set of village stocks reputedly used to punish the locals for minor crimes. 
Eyam has its own Parish Council with a wide range of powers at community level.[5] At district level, Eyam has representation on Derbyshire Dales District Council[6] and this, in turn, is represented on Derbyshire County Council.[7] At parliamentary level, the village lies within the constituency of Derbyshire Dales. 
Lead mining seems to have had a continuous history in the Eyam district since at least the Roman era and there is evidence of habitation from earlier. 
Stone circles and earth barrows on the moors above the present village have largely been destroyed, although some remain and more are recorded. 
The most notable site is the Wet Withens stone circle on Eyam Moor.[8] Coins bearing the names of many emperors provide evidence of Roman lead-mining locally.[9] However, the village's name derives from Old English and is first recorded in the Domesday Book as Aium. 
It is a dative form of the noun ēg (an island) and probably refers to a patch of cultivable land amidst the moors,[10] or else to the settlement's situation between two brooks.[11] 
The Boeing 747 is a large, long-range wide-body airliner designed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States between 1968 and 2022. 
After introducing the 707 in October 1958, Pan Am wanted a jet 2+1⁄2 times its size, to reduce its seat cost by 30% to democratize air travel. In 1965, Joe Sutter left the 737 development program to design the 747, the first twin-aisle airliner. 
In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 Boeing 747-100 aircraft and in late 1966, Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop its JT9D engine, a high-bypass turbofan. 
On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the custom-built Everett Plant, the world's largest building by volume. The first flight took place on February 9, 1969, and the 747 was certified in December of that year. 
It entered service with Pan Am on January 22, 1970. 
The 747 was the first airplane dubbed "Jumbo Jet", the first wide-body airliner.

Aimée Kabila Mulengela was said to be the natural daughter of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila and Zaïna Kibangula.[1] She would thus be the half-sister of President Joseph Kabila.[2] She was born on 24 July 1976 in Kipushi, Democratic Republic of Congo.[3] Laurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated on 16 January 2001 in Kinshasa and was succeeded ten days later by his son Joseph Kabila.[4] 
Aimée's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, left Kinshasa secretly in January 2002 for South Africa. 
He wanted to take Aimée with him but that was not possible since she was the mother of four children.[2] On 25 February 2005 she married Alain Mayemba Bamba, alias "Barracuda".[1][lower-alpha 1] A diplomatic passport was issued to her in the name "Aimée Kabila" on 7 April 2005.[3]

The seat of Ekurhuleni is Germiston. 
The city is home to South Africa's busiest airport, OR Tambo International Airport, which is located in the Kempton Park area of Ekurhuleni.[4] 
The name Ekurhuleni meaning place of peace alludes to the fact that the East Rand townships were the site of severe political violence between supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC in the early 1990s, prior to South Africa's first non-racial elections in 1994.[7]

Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa (born 29 November 1967[1]) is a South African recording artist, DJ, record producer and businessman.[2] Having been in the music industry for over 26 years, Oskido has reached a prominent status in the South African music industry, more-so in popular youth culture. 
He is undoubtedly one of the pioneering artists that popularised the Kwaito genre of music outside of the townships of South Africa, and he's been central to the rise of Afro-house and newer genres like amapiano.[citation needed] Oskido is the co-founder of Kalawa Jazmee Records (formerly Kalawa Records), a record label that is home to musical acts like Mafikizolo, Bongo Maffin, and many other foremost groups.[3] 
Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa born in November 26, 1967, to the late Zimbabwean father, Esaph Mdlongwa, who was a politician and a South African mother, Emily Sophia Molefi, in Oukasie township, Brits, North West, South Africa, Oskido spent most of his early life in Luveve Township, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, where he went on to finish his basic education after graduating from Gifford High School, Bulawayo. 
He returned to Brits at the age of 21 in 1988 to run a family business in Lethlabile, Brits shop before he left for Johannesburg to pursue a career in music. 
Oskido's career kicked off after he volunteered to perform at Razzmatazz when the scheduled DJ failed to show up. 
The late Ian Sigola played a major role in guiding him in the club scene by lending him his vinyls. 
After reworking songs and formulating his own sound in the studio, he went on to release the cassette compilations ‘Mixmaster’ and ‘Big Jam’, thus boosting his popularity outside of Johannesburg, before he was introduced to Bruce "Dope" Sebitlo, a South African music artist who went on partner Oskido in the Brothers of Peace group. 
Under the Brothers of Peace banner, Oskido and Sebitlo released and produced eight albums between 1994 and 2004, including the kwaito classic ' Makwerekwere' which discouraged Xenophobia on foreigners , as well as ‘Traffic Cop’ and the ground-breaking ‘Project A’ and ‘Zabalaza: Project B’ albums, which are Afro-house pioneers. 
The ‘Zabalaza’ title track made it to dancefloors across the globe when Louie Vega licensed and remixed it for his MAW Records label. 
He was also influential in setting up groups such as Mafikizolo, Bongo Muffin and Trompies. 
Mafikizolo is a South African Afro-pop music duo formed in 1996,[1] consisting of composer Theo Kgosinkwe and lead singer Nhlanhla Nciza.[2][3] The duo rose to fame after they released their singles "Ndihamba Nawe kuphela", "Kwela Kwela", "Sibongile", "Udakwa Njalo" . 
The group released their self-titled album Mafikizolo in 1997 and Music Revolution in 1999. 
In 2000, the band released their third album Gate Crashers, which became the best-selling album. 
Mafikizolo has won 14 South African Music Award, 2 MTV Africa Music Awards including the awards for Best Duo or Group of the Year.[4][5][6]

King Jama kaNdaba (c. 
1727–1781), the son of Ndaba kaMageba, was king of the Zulu Kingdom from 1763 to 1781. 
It is alleged he prophesied the birth of King Shaka. 
His grandfather was King Mageba kaGumede. 
Biography 
His name is derived from the Zulu word meaning "he of the stern countenance". 
He married, amongst others, Mthaniya Sibiya, who bore him Senzangakhona, who succeeded him.[1] Senzangakhona was the father of the three Zulu kings, including the greatest, Shaka. 
He also had a daughter named Mkabayi kaJama.[2] 
Mkabayi singlehandedly courted Mthaniya for her father Jama who was aging without having a successor. 
She did this without her father’s knowledge and when he found out he said: "Nenzengakhona", which means "you have done accordingly." 
Mthaniya’s first son was named Senzangakhona – "we have done accordingly", after his sister’s efforts to find her father a successor. 
Mkabayi was a twin and Zulu custom dictated that one of the twins be sacrificed to evade bad luck that would result in the death of one of the parents.[3]

She is perhaps best known for her Xhosa song, "Hamba Bhekile". 
An English version of the song, "We Are Growing" was used as soundtrack to the South African TV series Shaka Zulu. 
Early life 
Margaret Nomvula M'cingana was born in Queenstown, Eastern Cape, the daughter of Agnes M'cingana. 
In the 1950s, she moved from Queenstown to Johannesburg in the then Transvaal, where she found work as a domestic servant.[1] 
Music career 
While she was working as a domestic worker, Margaret Singana was discovered singing while cleaning.[2] Her employers were so impressed that they recorded her voice and sent the tape to a record company. 
The producers of the musical Sponono, written by Alan Paton, gave her a part as a chorus singer in 1964. 
"Singana" was an adaptation of her surname "M'cingana", meant to be easier for white people to pronounce.[3]

Tshekedi Stanford Khama (born 9 June 1958) is a Botswana politician. 
He is currently Member of Parliament for Serowe West, representing the Botswana Patriotic Front. 
Khama is one of four children of the first President of Botswana, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams Khama, and is the brother of former president Ian Khama.[1][2] 
Khama was elected to the National Assembly in Serowe North West in a 2008 by-election as a Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) member. 
He was subsequently re-elected in 2009 and 2014. 
From 2012 until 2018 he was Minister of Environment, Conservation, Natural Resources and Tourism. 
In 2018, President Mokgweetsi Masisi made him Minister of Youth Empowerment, Sports and Culture Development.[3] 
Following the victory of the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in the general election of October 1999, Khama remained Vice-President as well as Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration.[11][12] Mogae granted Khama a one-year leave later in the year,[13][14] a decision that the opposition Botswana Congress Party[13] and the Botswana Council of Non-Governmental Organizations sharply criticized. Khama's leave became effective on 1 January 2000.[14] He returned to his duties as Vice-President on 1 September 2000, although he was replaced as Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration at that time.[15] 
Khama, already a member of the BDP Central Committee,[16] was elected as Chairman of the BDP on 22 July 2003 at a party congress; he defeated the previous Chairman, Ponatshego Kedikilwe, receiving 512 votes against 219 for Kedikilwe.[17][18] Khama had been backed for the post by President Mogae,[16][19] paving the way for Khama to eventually succeed Mogae as President.[16][17] 
In April 2022, Ian Khama was summoned by the justice of his country. 
The former head of state is accused, among other things, of illegal possession of a firearm. 
The case dates back to 2016.[21] 
Mogae stepped down, as he had long said he would do,[23] on 1 April 2008; Khama succeeded him as President. At his swearing-in ceremony in Gaborone, Khama said that there would be continuity in policy and no "radical changes", although he said that "a change in style and special emphasis on a number of issues" might be evident, and he emphasized his commitment to democracy.[24] He immediately undertook a major cabinet reshuffle, and he appointed Mompati Merafhe, who had been Foreign Minister, as the new Vice-President.[25] Upon becoming President, Khama left his post as Chairman of the BDP; Daniel Kwelagobe was chosen to replace him.[26] Khama was not elected to the presidency for his first year in office, being appointed due to his position as Vice President.[clarification needed] Some political commentators such as Kenneth Good[27] see as a flaw in the electoral system in Botswana. 
Seretse Khama Ian Khama[1] (born 27 February 1953)[2] is a Botswana politician and former military officer who was the fourth President of the Republic of Botswana from 1 April 2008 to 1 April 2018. After serving as Commander of the Botswana Defence Force, he entered politics and was Vice-President of Botswana from 1998 to 2008, then succeeded Festus Mogae as President on 1 April 2008. 
He won a full term in the 2009 election and was re-elected in October 2014.[3] 
In 2015, Khama was awarded an honorary doctorate in political science from Konkuk University in South Korea.[56] After he received the degree, Khama's official title was "His Excellency the President Lieutenant General Dr Seretse Khama Ian Khama".[57] 
Under Khama, the government has also established the Directorate of Intelligence and Security Services (DISS) with police powers, which is seen as the Botswana equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States. 
Although this type of organization is not new and is found in many countries, it has critics in Botswana who charge that there are very few domestic or transnational threats that the police and the military could not handle. 
Some, including Executive director of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa, Siphosami Malunga, have argued that the institution, initially headed by President Khama's close friend Issac Kgosi, could easily be manipulated and used against political enemies or others who criticize the President or his administration.[62] 
On 1 April 2018, Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn in as the 5th President of Botswana, succeeding Ian Khama and his full ten years of presidency. 
After several disagreements with Masisi, in particular criticizing Masisi for authoritarian tendencies,[68] Khama decided to leave the BDP and join the Botswana Patriotic Front (BPF), a newly formed breakaway from the BDP. He campaigned for the BPF, which won three seats in the 2019 general elections in the Serowe area.[69] 
In 2018, after resigning from the presidency, Khama became a member of the Board of Directors of the US-based organization Conservation International, which is also active in Botswana.[70] 
In December 2022 a court in Botswana issued an arrest warrant for Khama for the possession of 5 illegal firearms after his failure to appear in court. 
In total he faces 14 charges.[71] 
Ian Khama is the second child of Sir Seretse Khama (1 July 1921 – 13 July 1980), Botswana's foremost independence leader and its president from 1966 to 1980, and Lady Khama. 
He was born in Chertsey, Surrey, while his father was living in exile in the United Kingdom, due to the opposition by the colonial government and the emergent apartheid regime in South Africa to his marriage to a white woman.[4]

The name "Seretse" means “the clay that binds together”, and was given to his father to celebrate the recent reconciliation of his father and grandfather; this reconciliation assured Seretse Khama's ascension to the throne when his aged father died in 1925. Ian Seretse Khama is named after his father to continue this historical legacy. 
He is also known simply as Ian Khama to differentiate between himself and his father. 
Tshekedi Khama II, Ian Khama's brother, was named after their great uncle, Tshekedi Khama who was the regent and guardian for Seretse Khama, the first president of Botswana.[5] 
Ian Khama was educated at Waterford Kamhlaba, a United World College in Mbabane,[6] and at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.[7] He is a qualified pilot. 
In April 1977, Khama was appointed as a brigadier general at age 24 during Sir Seretse Khama's Presidency, making him the Deputy Commander to late former Vice President Lt. Gen. Mompati Merafhe. He later served as the Commander of the Botswana Defence Force (BDF) from his appointment in 1989, retiring from the position in 1998. 
During this time, Khama received military honours, including the Founder Officer Medal for being part of the Botswana Defence Force when it was created in 1977, the Duty Code Order for devotion to duty, and the Distinguished Service Medal in 1997 after 20 years of service. 
Politically, Khama's election campaign was dominated by internal squabbling in the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP),[35] which was clearly divided into two major factions, the A-Team[36] and the Barata Phati factions.[37][38] The A-Team was led by President Khama, Jacob Nkate, the former minister of education, and the late former vice president Mompati Merafhe. 
In the run-up to the 2009 elections, Motswaledi, who gave up on his ambition to run for a seat in Serowe in order to make way for Ian Khama's brother, Tshekedi Khama II, was also excluded from representing Gaborone when he ran afoul of President Khama.[39] Motswaledi lost a law suit against Khama when the High Court ruled that the president enjoyed constitutional immunity from litigation by virtue of his position.[40] After this incident, critics accused Khama of authoritarian tendencies; More than half of the BDP central Committee at one time felt that Khama had on many instances acted beyond his powers.[41] Others, including Khama and his legal representation, said that he was simply instilling discipline as part of his role as the head of the party.[41]

Diep Ly Thanh was born in Tam Kỳ, South Vietnam, the daughter of Diep The Phu (Peter Yip) and Lam Que Anh (Ann Yip). 
She was blind from congenital cataracts, and a grandmother pressured her parents to find an herbalist to end the baby's life.[1] In 1979, she escaped Vietnam with dozens of family members, in a fishing boat. 
They landed in Hong Kong as refugees, and moved to California by the end of 1979. 
She was raised in Monterey Park, California. 
Her vision was improved with surgery in Los Angeles, but she remained legally blind.[2] 
Yip worked in corporate law in New York City from 2002.[1] In 2013, after being diagnosed with colon cancer, Yip-Williams started a blog, to share her experience with the disease and treatment, and to leave a record of herself for her young daughters. 
In her last months, she also made recordings for a podcast produced by Eleanor Kagan, titled Julie.[3][4] 
The blog and other writing by Yip-Williams, including a manuscript about her childhood, were compiled into a memoir, The Unwinding of the Miracle: A Memoir of Life, Death, and Everything That Comes After (2019), edited by her friend Mark Warren[5] and published posthumously.[6] The book was frequently compared to Paul Kalanithi's memoir When Breath Becomes Air (2016), and Nina Riggs' The Bright Hour (2017), which both had similar themes.[7][8] It was included in The New York Times' "100 Notable Books of 2019" annual feature.[9]

The company commenced when John Frederick Baumann migrated from England to South Africa, where in 1851 at the age of 26 he established a grocery and bread bakery in Durban, in the British Colony of Natal (now a province of South Africa). 
In 1879 Baumann visited London where he met with his nephew, John Michael Leonard Baumann, suggesting he emigrate to South Africa. 
J. M. L. Baumann had previously left his native village in Niederstetten, Germany at the age of 16, and moved to London where he worked as a baker's assistant before acquiring his own bakery business.[3] 
J. M. L. Baumann arrived in Durban in 1881 and joined his uncle's bakery and grocery business. 
A few years later when the lease on their premises expired, J. M. L. Baumann purchased the bakery operations from his uncle. 
He bought a site at the corner of Brickhill Road and West Street, where he constructed a small building. 
In 1885 Baumann purchased a hand-operated biscuit machine for £65 from another baker, Plowright. 
The machine produced 'dry' biscuits for sale to ships and army garrisons.

Elifasi Msomi a.k.a. The Axe Killer (1910 – 10 February 1956) was a South African serial killer who was convicted in 1955 of 15 murders and sentenced to death by hanging. 
His victims all came from the Umkomaas and Umzimkulu valleys of Natal. 
A Zulu man, Msomi was an unsuccessful young sangoma (shaman). 
Seeking professional assistance, he consulted with another sangoma. 
Msomi claims that during this exchange he was co-opted by an evil spirit, a tokoloshe. 
In August 1953, under the instruction of the tokoloshe, Msomi began an 18-month killing spree in the southern KwaZulu-Natal valleys of South Africa.[1] 
Msomi initially raped and murdered a young woman in the presence of his mistress, whose blood he kept in a bottle. 
Unimpressed with his 'new' powers, his mistress alerted the police who arrested Msomi. 
He escaped shortly afterwards, giving credit for his escape to the all-powerful tokoloshe.[1] Msomi returned to his murderous ways, killing five children before being re-arrested. 
He duly escaped again. 
Msomi was arrested a month later for petty theft. 
The stolen items turned out to belong to his victims and he was soon identified as the murderous culprit.

William Anderson was the first of Mrs. Janet and Rev Tiyo Soga’s eight children born between 1858 and 1870. 
William was, according to his death notice[4] and his matriculation certificate[5] born in Peelton, near King William’s Town (renamed Qonce in 2021). William Soga spent his childhood at Mgwali mission station in Stutterheim, Amathole District which was run by his parents and where most of his siblings were born.[6] 
From 1867 William Anderson (age 9) attended Lovedale Seminary (later college), his father’s alma mater.[13] After ten years of building the Mgwali Mission Station and its congregation, the Soga family moved to Tutura in the Transkei in the eastern Cape. 
It was around this time that Tiyo and Janet Soga started preparing William, John and Alan to be educated abroad specifically in Glasgow, Scotland.[14] In 1870 William, now 12 years old, John Henderson (age 10) and Kirkland Allan (age 9) departed from South Africa leaving behind their extended South African family, younger siblings (Isabella McFarlane, Jotello Festiri and Francis Anne), their mother (pregnant with Jessie who was born in June 1870) and their father Tiyo who was very ill at the time and would die on 12 August 1871 without having seen them again.

Emmanuel Asanda "Scara" Ngobese (3 June 1980 – 11 May 2010) was a South African soccer player who last played as a midfielder for Kaizer Chiefs FC in the Premier Soccer League. 
He was born in Katlehong, Gauteng and died in Johannesburg. 
Ngobese was affectionately known to his supporters as "Scara" or "The Black Jesus" . 
He was managed by Edgar O.[1] 
After Dumitru's departure, Chiefs hired the German coach Ernst Middendorp who sidelined Ngobese for the whole season, alleging he was confusing professional soccer for street football. 
By the time Ernst Middendorp left the team at the end of the season, Ngobese was completely out of form. 
The German international relieved Ngobese of his contract duties and was signed by Thanda Royal Zulu where he never played any significant games, and it is here that he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was forced to hang his boots until he met his demise a few years later. 
Ngobese died on 11 May 2010 of tuberculosis,[2] after having suffered from the disease since 2008. This was exactly a month before the start of the historical South African version of the FIFA World Cup on June 11 of 2010. 
An event he would've partaking in if it weren't for his sudden ailment, forced retirement and untimely death. 
South African rapper Kwesta paid homage to Scara by appearing on his "Spirit" music video wearing a shirt with Ngobese's name and his Kaizer Chiefs jersey number (11) printed on it.[3][4] The music video premiered on SABC 1 on 30 December 2017 and features American recording artist, Wale. 
DJ Fanatic, Reason and Kwesta made a song called "Number 11" (which is the kit number he used for most of his soccer career) to pay homage to the dribbling wizard.[5] 
Harambe (May 27, 1999 – May 28, 2016) was a western lowland gorilla who lived at the Cincinnati Zoo from 2014 to 2016, and previously at the Gladys Porter Zoo for 15 years. 
On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy climbed into a gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden where he was grabbed and dragged by Harambe.[3] Fearing for the boy's life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe. 
The incident was recorded on video and received broad international coverage and commentary, including controversy over the choice to use lethal force. 
A number of primatologists and conservationists wrote later that the zoo had no other choice under the circumstances, and that it highlighted the danger of zoo animals near humans and the need for better standards of care.

Harambe became the subject of internet memes, songs, a video game, a statue, and other tributes and recognitions. 
White trash is a derogatory racial and class-related slur[1][2] used in American English to refer to poor white people, especially in the rural areas of the southern United States. The label signifies a social class inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.[3] It is used as a way to separate the "noble and hardworking" "good poor" from the lazy, "undisciplined, ungrateful and disgusting" "bad poor". The use of the term provides middle- and upper-class whites a means of distancing themselves from the poverty and powerlessness of poor whites, who cannot enjoy those privileges, as well as a way to disown their perceived behavior.[1] 
The term has been adopted for people living on the fringes of the social order, who are seen as dangerous because they may be criminal, unpredictable, and without respect for political, legal, or moral authority.[4] While the term is mostly used pejoratively by urban and middle-class whites as a class signifier,[5] some white entertainers self-identify as "white trash", considering it a badge of honor, and celebrate the stereotypes and social marginalization of lower-class whiteness.
